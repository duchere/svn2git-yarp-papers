The model adaptation method presented in this paper stems from a
problem in adaptive hand prosthetics, namely: is it possible to help a
patient learn to use a dexterous hand prosthesis in a quicker and
better way, by exploiting the common features found in models trained
upon other patients?

The answer, at least as far as healthy subjects is concerned, is
yes. We have hereby presented a novel method for model adaptation in
machine learning, using Least-Squares SVMs. The idea is that of
... \textbf{FRANCESCO...}

We tested our method on a large database built with EMG and force data
from $10$ healthy subjects, trying to improve the training times of
one subject by pre-training on other subjects. The outcome of the
experiment is positive: it is apparent that a large amount of
knowledge stored in LS-SVM models is common to all subjects, which is
probably due to the anatomical analogies among the arms. A careful
positioning of the electrodes on the subjects' forearms has the
beneficial effect of damping the noise introduced by anatomical
differences.

It remains to discover whether this idea can be transferred to
amputees: amputations are, obviously, non-controlled, traumatic events
(except in some cases), and therefore stumps exhibit much more
variability than healthy forearms. This is the subject of future
research.
