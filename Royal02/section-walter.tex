\section{Introduction}

A truly autonomous robot needs to be able to explore and learn from
its environment, since it cannot rely on receiving all the information
it needs passively~\cite{whaite97autonomous}.
It is telling that some of the earliest autonomous robots ever built,
the tortoises of W. Grey Walter, were given the mock-Linnean
designation ``Machina Speculatrix'' to emphasize their exploratory
behavior, described as: ``it explores its environment actively,
persistently, systematically as most animals do''
\cite{walter50imitation}.
These robots had very simple control circuitry, and their behavior
depended greatly on the morphology and dynamics of their own bodies.
