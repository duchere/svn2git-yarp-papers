\section{Discussion and Conclusions}

In this paper, we showed how causality can be probed at different
levels by the robot.  Initially the environment was the body of the
robot itself, then later a carefully circumscribed interaction with
the outside world.  This is reminiscent of Piaget's distinction
between primary and secondary circular
reactions~\cite{ginsburg78piaget}.  Objects are central to interacting
with the ouside world.  We raised the issue of how an agent can
autonomously acquire a working definition of objects. 

We have shown that, without any prior knowledge of the human form, 
the robot can identify episodes when a human is manipulating objects
that are familiar to the robot.  So we don't need an appearance model 
of either a human arm or the human form in general.

According to
recent neuroscience results the problem is ``well posed'' only if the
agent is embodied.

the concept of causality and to a certain extent
our particular implementation fit well with a bulk of neural science
results. Implementing a model of development might help to 
understand ``how the brain does it''.

The number of papers written on techniques for visual segmentation is
vast.  Methods for characterizing the shape of an object through
tactile information are also being developed, such as shape from
probing

%%\cite{cole87shape,paulos99fast} 
or pushing
\cite{moll01reconstructing}.

But while it has long
been known that motor strategies can aid
vision~\cite{ballard91animate}, work on active vision has focused
almost exclusively on moving cameras.  There is much to be gained by
bringing a manipulator into the equation~\cite{tsikos91segmentation}.

Our view is that while biologists are doing a good job of elucidating
{\em what} mirror neurons are and how they operate, work like ours can
more readily clarify {\em why} they are useful in practice.  We
believe that answer lies in the developmental process.  A creature
created fully formed could perhaps operate just fine without mirror
neurons, but to reach adult competence from a more primitive stage
requires continuously interleaving perception with experimental action
-- a situation that seems to call for mirror neurons and similar
machinery.  Our goal is to build a robot capable of such
experimentation, and to identify specific functional advantages of
mirror-like representation in the development of its visual
competence.  Knowledge of functional advantages could suggest new and
interesting things for biologists to look for that they may not have
thought of (since they have never tried to actually build a vision
system themselves).

Many variants and extensions to the
experimental ``poking'' strategy explored here are possible.  For
example, a robot might try to move an arm around {\em behind} the
object.  As the arm moves behind the object, it reveals its occluding
boundary.  This is a precursor to visually extracting shape
information while actually manipulating an object, which is more
complex since the object is also being moved and partially occluded by
the manipulator.  Another possible strategy that could be adopted as a
last resort for a confusing object might be to simply hit it firmly,
in the hopes of moving it some distance and potentially overcoming
local, accidental visual ambiguity.  Obviously this strategy cannot
always be used!  But there is plenty of room to be creative here.
