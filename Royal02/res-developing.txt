There is considerable precedent in the biological literature for a strong connection 
between viewing object manipulation performed by either oneself or another 
(Wohlsclager and Bekkering 2002). Also the role of object in the understanding
of action performed by others has been investigated [CITE Woodward]. In a series of 
experiments Woodward and colleagues elucidated which is the contribution of seeing an object
in 5, 6, and 9 month old infants. They provided evidence that the object and the
goal-directness of the action represent an important component in the understanding of
the intentions of others. 

At the neural level, we already mentioned the presence of neurons in F5 that have a 
very specific response when an object is either fixated or manipulated (canonical 
neurons). Grossly simplifying, we might think of canonical neurons as an association table
of grasp/manipulation (action) types with object (vision) types.

F5 contains also mirror neurons. These neurons, as we described before, respond
when either watching somebody else performing a manipulative action or when actually
manipulating an object. They can be thought of as a second-level association map which 
links together the observation of a manipulative action performed by somebody else 
with the neural representation of one's own action.

The question of whether a mirror-like representation can be autonomously developed by
the robot (or a human for what matters) can then be answered. The association map can be
constructed by identifying when the goal and the object are the same irrespective of 
who is the actor. Actions that lead to the same consequences are thus part of the same
equivalence class that is exactly what mirror neurons are.
