Cog runs the distributed attentional system described in [Metta
Humanoids].  The attentional system consists of a set of pre-attentive
filters sensitive to motion, color, and binocular disparity. The
different filters generate information on the likelihood that
something interesting is happening in a certain region of the image. A
voting mechanism is used to "decide" what to attend and track
next. The pre-attentive filters are implemented on a space-variant
imaging system know as logpolar [cite]. This mimics the distribution
of photoreceptors in the human retina [cite Schwartz].
 
The attentional system uses vision and non-visual sensors
(e.g. inertial) to generate a range of oculomotor behaviors. Examples
are saccades, smooth pursuit, vergence, and the vestibulo-ocular
reflex (VOR).

[this is to add to the section on the experimental setup, I'll send
you the references later if we have room for them. Otherwise we can
drop some of them]
