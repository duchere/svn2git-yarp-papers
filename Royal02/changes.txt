Title: Grounding vision through experimental manipulation

Authors: Paul Fitzpatrick and Giorgio Metta

This paper presents a defence of the idea that manipulating objects by
an autonomous robot helps vision.

However the paper is unclear on many points.

- The term "grounding vision" is not explained in the paper, so it is
difficult for the reader to evaluate the contributions of the paper.

*** pending

- The target audience is unclear.  For instance, in section 1, it is
noted that the complexity of vision cannot be grasped intuitively.
For those who work in artificial vision, the complexity of vision is
painfully clear.  So, this note must be directed to readers naïve in
computer vision.  However, the justification of the work described
in the paper heavily relies on knowledge of previous work by Ballard
(1991) that is not described at all, thus assuming a reader specialized
in the domain.  Similarly, in p.6, the authors refer to "long-standing
problems in machine vision" without making them explicit.

*** reviewer seems to equate intuition with judgement of a specialist!
*** but rephrase anyway

- The statement that vision is full of illusions (p.2) is true in a
philosophical sense, and in some specially designed experiments.  However,
everyday vision is very effective at correctly recognizing objects, even
with few cues.  Hence, the "crucial" contribution of tapping an object
(p.3) is a little bit overstated.

*** pending

- The paper suggests that tapping will lead to a "manipulation-driven
representation of objects" (p.3).  However, what their results show is
that when you move an object, it can be separated from the background,
smartly filled in and its principal axes determined.  Then, if this is
repeated many times, one can determine the probability that the object
rolls by a given angle.  Is the probability graph the representation of
the object?  There is a mention of a colour segmentation method, but no
details are given.  Maybe the whole process of building a representation
should be made more explicit.  What information is stored?  How is
the learning procedure organized? (For example, does the object need
to be put back in the same place after each tapping?)  Both pieces of
information would help understand what "manipulation-driven representation
of objects" is.  These would also make more clear how much this approach
is suitable for truly autonomous robots.

*** pending MOD:REPRESENTATION

- The work on mirror neurons is quite obscure.  On p.5, it is said that
affordance neurons and mirror neurons are found in area F5.  Both seem
to be active when observing manipulation tasks.  Are they not the same?
Similarly to Ballard's paper that is key in the argumentation of the
paper, Gallese's paper is key to the argumentation about mirror neurons.
The authors should give more details on the experiments described in these
papers.  In particular, the conclusion that "object and goal-directedness
of the actions represent an important component in the understanding of
the intentions of others" needs more careful elaboration.  At present,
it is unclear how "these results" support that statement.

*** pending MOD:MIRROR

- P.6.  What is the meaning of "bootstrap perception"?

*** pending

- Figure 8 (p.10).  Is the arm "tapping the object" or "following a
pre-programmed trajectory that brings it in contact with the object"?
The first description communicates the notion of an intentional movement
directed towards an object.  As I understand it , the robot has neither
intentions nor the notion of what an object is.  (On p.11, the target
seems actually defined by the authors, not the robot).  Maybe the caption
could be corrected?

*** pending MOD:SEMANTICS

- More about mirror neurons.  In the paper (p.16), the robot tries to
determine the movement of an operator by observing how the object moves.
Is the object required in animal experiments?  If not, the relation of
this work with mirror neurons is very tenuous.  This could be left out
of the paper to make more space for other clarifications called for above.

*** pending MOD:OPERATOR

- P.18.  The notes about predicting the future and inverting causal
relations are very speculative, it seems, and unsupported.

*** pff

Overall, the authors should make more clear what problem they try to
solve and explain in more details how they solve it.

*** above mods should do that


REVIEWER 2
==========

This paper provides a detailed discussion as to how causality can be
probed at different levels by a robot.  It provides a linkage between the
authors' work and neurobiology.  The paper is well written and provides
a good review of the subject matter.  The discussion on examining
the results of poking and observing the motion are of some interest.
Regarding figure 14, the definition of the principal axis of a cube and
ball need to be more carefully considered.  Can the principal axis of
a ball be defined (given its symmetry)?

*** exactly!

In addition:

* does the cube roll or slide?

*** It slides

* is the direction of the ball only dependant on the direction of the
"poke"?  What about the ball's dynamics and the surface?

*** pending

The following also require attention:

* The reference to Berkeley needs to be clarified.

*** pending

* Some of the images are rather small, particularly 6 and 7 where it is
difficult to see the fine detail.

*** a consequence of pdf conversion -- drops resolution
*** pending MOD:RESOLUTION

I would like to see this paper published due to is high accessibility and
scope.

Fitzpatrick and Metta: Grounding vision through experimental manipulation

Summary 

The paper presents a series of experiments conducted with the upper-torso
humanoid robot Cog, whose purpose it was to achieve image segmentation
and visual scene interpretation through object manipulation.  In a first
series of experiments, background was separated from object and robot arm
by means of image differencing or background modelling, while the robot's
gaze was fixed (thus not inducing any optic flow).  In a second set of
experiments, the authors attempted to develop artificial mirror neurons
in the robot, i.e. neurons that fire either when an action is performed,
or when its performance is merely observed.  The method employed was to
learn the typical response of a small number (four) of objects to one
of four actions, and subsequently to identify the action performed by
a human operator, using this knowledge.

Discussion 

The paper is very well written, and makes interesting reading.  The
fundamental point that action should be linked with perception ("active
perception") is well taken, and also by now widely accepted in robotics.
This paper makes an interesting contribution to how this can be achieved.

Having read the paper, I would have liked to see more discussion on
two points:

(1) The idea that by actively manipulating an object and observing the
results -- taking into account proprioceptive information -- one can
separate object and background seems so obvious that one wonders why it
hasn't been done before.  In fact, the authors refer to Ballard's work of
eleven years ago, but do not enter a deeper discussion.  The experimental
results are fine, and the overall point is interesting, but I feel it
should be argued more strongly what the contribution of this paper is,
in contrast to existing work.

*** pending contrasts, say with lift-and-segment
*** pending MOD:CONTRAST

(2) The attempt to move towards a "passive" understanding of objects and
their affordances (mirror neuron, section 10) by learning the effects of
the four possible actions, and the responses of four different objects to
these actions) first, and then analysing the results of human-performed
actions, is interesting, and the results look promising.  However, it
seems that the approach is crucially dependent on the fact that there
is only a small number of possible actions, and probably also on the
fact that there is a small number of objects.  How will this scale?
Is this approach suitable for anything but the smallest set of actions
and objects?  If it isn't, that wouldn't necessarily be to the detriment
of the paper but we would like to know.

*** pending MOD:SCALING

Also, the authors should discuss how much the method discussed in section
10 is dependent on the correct object identification. What happens if
the bottle is confused with the car?

*** pending MOD:MISIDENTIFICATION

Smaller points 

Figures 6 and 7 are hard to read. 

*** pending MOD:RESOLUTION

The flipper is found by a heuristic (p.10).  How much does this heuristic
influence the generality of the method?

*** pending

The significance of section 9 is unclear.  Neither the objectives nor
the results presented there seem particularly relevant to the paper,
and the paper might benefit from the omission of that section.

*** pending MOD:OPERATOR

The term "signature explosion of movement" (p.12) should be explained.
The sixth sentence from the top on p.14 is incomplete ("simply by checking
whether its arm ...").

*** pending

The discussion of results on p.15 should be expanded.  What is counted
as a "mistake"?  How were these measured?

*** pending MOD:MISTAKE



============================================================================

MOD:BALLARD

Ballard among others posit that behavioral assumptions might be taken
into account to simplify the extraction of visual cues such as shape
from shading, kinetic depth, optic flow, etc[***]. Conversely general
purpouse vision is too uncostrained to be feasible. Another behavioral
simplification induced by the Ballard's animate vision paradigm is the
sequentialization of visual tasks. Observing that the human visual
system is space-variant (i.e. photoreceptors are not evenly distributed
in the retina), requires that visual data can be only gathered by
placing the high-resolution fovea at interesting conspicuous places in
the visual field. One example also brought forward by Ballard (cite) is
the early experimental recording of eye movements of Yarbus [**]. The
path of movement of the eyes clearly showed that the eye movements are
function of what is asked to the subject (e.g. tell the age of the
people in the scene), meaning that it is not usual to store huge amount
of visual data into some internal representations. Also Brooks (cite)
basically restates one of the main tenets of Gibson's indirect
perception [*] when advocates that behavior can do without an internal
(or with a minimal) representation. Both Gibson and later Brooks
proposed that the information is mostly contained in the environment
rather than internally in the agent.
