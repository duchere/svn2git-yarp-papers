In previous work \cite{2008.ICRA,2008.BioCyb} we have shown that
forearm surface electromyography (EMG) can be effectively used to
control a dexterous mechanical hand, thus laying the basis of
EMG-based control of polyarticulate hand prostheses, such as, e.g.,
Touch Bionics's i-LIMB hand. Forearm surface EMG is relatively cheap
and totally non-invasive, thus avoiding the problems normally
associated to surgical prosthetics.

So far, the analysis has been concerned with one subject only, fully
able-bodied, and in highly controlled conditions, i.e., with his arm
relaxed and still on a table. In this paper we carry the analysis on
and solve some of the problems left open in the aforementioned
paper.

Namely, we describe the outcome of a similar experiment, in which the
task was to press a force sensor in different grasping ways. In this
experiment however, $10$ healthy subjects participated, and they were
also left free to walk, raise their hands and arms, sit down and stand
up, etc., as a patient is supposed to do during Daily-Life
Activities. The experiment reveals that machine learning techniques
such as Support Vector Machines are able to achieve good to excellent
results in this framework also.

We also propose a cross-subject model analysis, \textbf{che ci
dice?}...
