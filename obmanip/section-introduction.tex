Interaction.


Current robots are capabable of doing some manipulation tasks once they have an object securely attached to its limb. This is achieved by placing the object in a specific position where the robot limb repeateadly  grab th object. That is in a very engineered environment. Some other even clamp the object directly to the hand. 

Given that the initial phase is not automatic many robotic tasks are rendered unexecutable. A main reason to avoid solving this task is teh alck of sensors availbale to the robot at this stage.

Sensitive Maniputaltion on the other hand, starts at this point by solvinthe initial grasping problem. The idea is that if you can realiably grab unmodelede objects just by feeling many a big part of the porblem is solved  (Review this)
