We present the design, analysis and construction of a biologically
inspired tactile sensor. The sensor can measure normal and lateral
forces, conform to the surfaces with which it comes in contact and
increase the friction of the surface for a good grasp.

The sensor is built using a simple process and the applied forces
are read using standard electronics. These features make the
sensors ideal for mass production.

We are motivated to build tactile sensors that are useful for
robotic manipulation given that the current ones do not have the
features that we consider necessary. The sensors presented in this
paper deal with these problems. They have been designed to fit the
fingers of the robot Obrero \cite{obrero}.
