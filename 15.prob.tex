Our study mainly aims at answering the following question: can we
improve the training time a patient must undergo when learning to use
an adaptive prosthesis? In particular, since we have at our disposal a
data set gathered from $10$ subjects, can we somehow exploit the
analogies among the subject-wise data sets to build a model which will
give a headstart to the adaptation on a new, so far unseen patient?

Since we use machine learning, the question is equivalent to: can we
use model adaptation to obtain good results when these models are used
as a starting point for the adaptation on new data?
