<p>Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine is an international peer-review journal published in English, with 10 issues per year (as of volume 40, 2008). Original articles, reviews, case reports, short communications, special reports and letters to the editor are published, as are also editorials and book reviews. The journal aims to be a broad forum for different areas of research in rehabilitation medicine, including functional assessment and intervention studies, clinical studies in various patient groups, papers on methodology in physical and rehabilitation medicine, epidemiological studies on disabling conditions and reports on vocational and sociomedical aspects of rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Contributions from all parts of the world and from different professions in rehabilitation are welcome.
</p>
<p>Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine is greatly in favour of progress towards open access to published material. For further information concerning the present policy of the journal see the <a title="Open Access Policy" href="openaccess.php">open access policy</a> for Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine. Also, note the possibility for the author(s) to deposit their manuscript at their own website or university repository, as seen <a href="#deposit">below</a>. There is also a possibility for the authors to obtain immediate open access at an extra cost.</p>
<p>Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine is the official journal of the <a href="http://www.euro-prm.org">European Board of Physical Rehabilitation Medicine (EBPRM)</a>, the <a href="http://www.aemr.eu/">European Academy of Rehabilitation Medicine</a> and the <a href="http://www.isprm.org">International Society of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (ISPRM)</a>.</p>



<h4><a href="#top" title="Top of page"><img src="img/arrow.gif" alt="" height="10" width="12" border="0"></a> <a name="submission"></a>Preparing for submission</h4>
<p>Submission of a manuscript is held to imply that it has not previously been published and is not otherwise submitted for publication, except as an abstract (which in that case has to be stated). Submission can be made online at <a href="http://www.medicaljournals.se/jrm/">www.medicaljournals.se/jrm</a>. (A complete copy of the manuscript, including tables and figures, accompanied by a submission letter can also be sent via ordinary mail if the internet option is not possible. In that case, please also submit a floppy disc with the complete manuscript.) 
</p>

<p>In writing your paper, you are encouraged to review articles in the area you are addressing including those which have been previously published in the journal, and to reference them where you feel it is appropriate. This will enhance context, coherence, and continuity for our readers.
Submit the manuscript (including tables and figures) as a styled Microsoft Word file and photographs as separate EPS or TIFF files with a resolution of at least 300 dpi. Black-and-white digital images should be in grayscale mode and colour images saved in CMYK, not index or RGB, colour mode. For further information please contact the Editorial office</p>


<p>It is possible to upload one manuscript file and three image files at a time. If you need to upload more image files than three, you will be given the opportunity to do so after pressing "Upload". Please name the manuscript file according to the formula "Firstauthorname.doc" and any image files "Firstauthornamefig1.doc" etc. When uploading revised manuscripts, please name the manuscript file manuscript number + "ver" + version number in Roman numerals, eg. 123456verIII.doc.<br>
Should you have questions regarding submission online, contact us via e-mail (<A HREF="mailto:j.rehab.med@rehab.uu.se?subject=Submission online">mailto:j.rehab.med@rehab.uu.se</a>).<br>
The corresponding author will be notified that the manuscript has been received.
</p>


<p><a href="#top" title="Top of page"><img src="img/arrow.gif" alt="" height="10" width="12" border="0"></a> <a name="checklist"></a><i>Checklist</i>. Before finally submitting your paper, please refer to the <a href="http://www.medicaljournals.se/jrm/checklist.php">checklist</a> and verify that everything has been taken care of.
</p>


<p><i>Language.</i> All papers should be written in English. It is essential that the language is irreproachable. If the Editorial Board should consider it necessary, manuscripts will be subjected to language examination at the author's risk and expense. Authors whose first language is not English are recommended to have their manuscripts checked carefully before submission.
</p>


<p><i>Duplicate publication.</i> It is not acceptable to submit papers already published elsewhere or simultaneously submit a paper to another journal.  Furthermore, the paper must not be under review in another journal. Accompanying the manuscript should be a copy of all references mentioned in the particular paper still not published and articles by the same authors on the same subject submitted elsewhere.</p>


<h4><a href="#top" title="Top of page"><img src="img/arrow.gif" alt="" height="10" width="12" border="0"></a> <a name="authorship"></a>Authorship</h4>
<p>All persons designated as authors must participate sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility in its contents. For criteria for authors see &quot;Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals&quot; Ann Intern Med 1997; 126: 36-47, or JAMA 1997; 277: 927-34. The full document is available at www.icmje.org. In essence authorship requires substantial contributions to (1) conception and design, (2) analysis and interpretation of data, (3) drafting the article or reviewing it critically for important intellectual content, (4) final approval of the version submitted. Participation solely in the acquisition of funding or the collection of data does not justify authorship, nor does general supervision of the research group. The author who submits the manuscript should state if the authors meet these criteria. If there are 5 authors or more, a statement on each author's contribution must be described in the accompanying letter. In multicenter trials group members not meeting these criteria should be listed, with their permission, in the acknowledgement or appendix. All persons mentioned in the Acknowledgement should have accepted this to the responsible author.</p>
		<h4><a href="#top" title="Top of page"><img src="img/arrow.gif" alt="" height="10" width="12" border="0"></a> <a name="deposit"></a>Deposit of manuscript</h4>
		<p>When submitting a paper to our journal you are allowed to deposit the paper in a manuscript form at your website or university repository with acknowledgement where it is considered for publication. After acceptance the printed article (pdf) may be posted similarly, after an embargo period of 6 months, with a link to the publisher's online version.</p>
		<h4><a href="#top" title="Top of page"><img src="img/arrow.gif" alt="" height="10" width="12" border="0"></a> <a name="type"></a>Type and length of papers</h4>
		<p>Original articles should not exceed 9 printed pages (approx. 25 double-spaced manuscript pages including the reference list). We usually would like to limit the number of references in the original papers to not more than 35. Additional pages must be paid for by the authors at a rate of USD150, Euro 140 per page.
</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Publication categories</span><br>
<i>Reviews</i> should usually also be limited to around 9 printed pages, if not due to special and agreed reasons, but since they often require a larger number of references the length of the paper will increase accordingly. Reviews may be invited on specific topics, but submitted reviews without previous invitation are also welcome. However, it is advisable in such cases to submit a short summary of the paper first for Editorial comments regarding whether publication is feasible. We will also publish invited &quot;Educational reviews&quot;.<br>
<i>Short communications</i> and <i>case reports</i> should not exceed 3 printed pages (approximately 8 double-spaced manuscript pages), including figures, tables and a reference list.
<br>
<i>Special reports</i> may be between 3 and 9 pages depending on the topic and structure of the paper.<br>
<i>Letters to the Editor</i> commenting on a published article or covering other matters of general interest are welcome. They should, however, be kept short, and have only a few references. When commenting a published paper, the authors of that paper will also be invited to write a comment to be published together with the Letter. The Editor reserves the right to determine which letters should be published.<br>Review papers, Letters to the Editor and in some cases Special reports will be published as soon as possible, whereas other papers will usually be published in the general order they have been accepted for publication. All papers will, however, be available on the net as soon as they have been proof read and corrected.<br>
Regularly <i>CME</i> questions are published referring to a particular review article in the same issue.
</p>


<h4><a href="#top" title="Top of page"><img src="img/arrow.gif" alt="" height="10" width="12" border="0"></a> <a name="conflict"></a>Conflict of interest and funding</h4>
<p>Authors are responsible for recognising and disclosing financial and other conflicts of interest that might bias their work. They should acknowledge all financial support for the work and other financial or personal connections to the work in the manuscript. Where necessary, it should be stated that the funding agency e.g. a pharmaceutical or instrumental company, has had no influence of the interpretation of data and the final conclusions drawn. Thus, authors must disclose any commercial associations that might impose a conflict of interest in connection within the study.
</p>


<h4><a href="#top" title="Top of page"><img src="img/arrow.gif" alt="" height="10" width="12" border="0"></a> <a name="ethics"></a>Ethics and consent</h4>
<p>When reporting studies on human subjects, indicate whether the procedures followed have been approved by an Ethics committee (in accordance with ethical standards on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 1983). Do not use patients' names, initials, or hospital numbers, especially in illustrative material. Identifying information should not be published in written descriptions, photographs, and pedigrees unless the information is essential for scientific purposes and the patient (or parent or guardian) gives written informed consent for publication. Informed consent for this purpose requires that the patient be shown the manuscript to be published.
</p>


<h4><a href="#top" title="Top of page"><img src="img/arrow.gif" alt="" height="10" width="12" border="0"></a> <a name="arrangement"></a>Formatting guidelines</h4>
<p>Manuscripts should be typewritten, <i>double-spaced</i> throughout, on one side of the paper, with ordinary margins. Papers should usually be divided into Title page, Abstract, Introduction (including clear statement of the aim of the study), Methods, Results, Discussion and References. </p>

All abbreviations should be explained the first time they are used - unless it is a standard unit of measurement - and thereafter the use of abbreviations should be consistent throughout the paper. Avoid excessive use of abbreviations. Never use abbreviations in the article's title or in the Abstract. 
</p>

<p><i>Title page:</i> A separate title page is necessary and should bear
<ol type="a"><li>title of the article,
<li>full names of the authors (first name and last name), and highest academic degree
<li>institutions of origin,
<li>a short title, and the corresponding author's name, address, telefax number and e-mail
</ol></p>

<p><i>Abstract:</i> Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine requires structured abstracts for all original articles. The following headlines should be used where appropriate: Objective, Design, Subjects/Patients, Methods, Results and Conclusion. The total number of words should not exceed 200. A list of from 3-8 key-words or terms from Medical Subject Headings (Bethesda, Md. 1966) suitable for indexing terms should be typed at the bottom of the abstract page.<br>
Below the abstract: Title of journal; The principal author's complete address, including e-mail.
</p>

<p><i>Introduction:</i> State the purpose of the article and justify the study, why is it needed. Summarize the rationale for the study. Give only pertinent references, do not review the subject extensively.
</p>

<p><i>Methods: </i>Describe the selection of the subjects. Give details about randomisation. Present characteristics of the subjects/patients; if pertinent use ICF terms from corresponding short forms of core sets (<a href="http://jrm.medicaljournals.se/issue/36/44">J Rehabil Med 2004; Suppl 44</a> and <a href="http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=issue&issn=0963%2d8288&volume=27&issue=7">Disabil Rehabil 2005; 27: issues 7 &amp; 8</a>).Describe methods for any blinding of the observations. Identify methods, equipment/materials, and procedures in sufficient details, including pertinent references, to allow others to reproduce the study. Names and addresses of the manufacturers and/or suppliers of equipment and/or materials used in a study must be identified by names, town, and stated the first time the equipment/materials is mentioned. For statistical methods, see below.</p>


<p><i>Results:</i> Present results in logical sequence in the text, tables, and figures. Avoid repeating information in text, tables and figures. Restrict tables and figures to those needed to explain arguments and to assess their support. Use figures as an alternative to tables with many entries. Do not write in the text what variable are seen in a table but which are the main findings. Thus write &quot;In table xx is seen&quot; or give the reference to the specific table in parenthesis after the main information seen in the table is presented.
</p>


<p><i>Discussion:</i> Start with one paragraph summary of the main findings.  Then place your study in context, referring to other relevant work. Do not repeat in detail data or other information presented in the Introduction or Result section. Discuss the limitation of the methods and the results presenting the clinical relevance of your study and the implications for future studies. Address the issue of effect magnitude, in terms of both the statistics reported and the implications of the results. You should not use a specific headline for conclusion, but if pertinent, start the last paragraph with &quot;In conclusion,&quot;.
</p>


<h4><a href="#top" title="Top of page"><img src="img/arrow.gif" alt="" height="10" width="12" border="0"></a> <a name="statistics"></a>Statistics</h4>
<p>Describe statistical methods with enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader with access to the original data to verify the reported results. When possible, quantify findings and present them with appropriate indicators of measurement error or uncertainty (such as confidence intervals). Avoid relying solely on statistical hypothesis testing, such as the use of p-values, which fails to convey important quantitative information. Calculations of power should be performed when appropriate. For analysis of reliability, use adequate methods. Statistical methods for data from rating scales must take account of the rank-invariant properties of ordinal data. The median level and the quartiles are appropriate measure for describing the distribution of ordinal data. Discuss the eligibility of experimental subjects. For randomised controlled trials (RCT) the authors should follow the guidelines of reporting RCT given by CONSORT (<a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/">http://www.consort-statement.org/</a>). </p>
<p>The CONSORT statement is an important research tool that takes an evidence-based approach to improve the quality of reports of randomized trials. Its critical value to researchers, health care providers, peer reviewers, and journal editors, and health policy makers is the guarantee of integrity in the reported results of research.
CONSORT comprises a checklist and flow diagram to help improve the quality of reports of randomized controlled trials. It offers a standard way for researchers to report trials. The checklist includes items, based on evidence, that need to be addressed in the report; the flow diagram provides readers with a clear picture of the progress of all participants in the trial, from the time they are randomized until the end of their involvement. The intent is to make the experimental process clearer, flawed or not, so that users of the data can more appropriately evaluate its validity for their purposes.
</p>
<p>When analysing several outcome variables and/or investigating the relationship between many variable consider to use multivariate statistical methods. Describe the methods for and success of any blinding of observations. Report losses to observation (such as dropouts from a clinical trial). References for the design of the study and statistical methods should be to standard works when possible (with pages stated) rather than to papers in which the design or methods were originally reported. Specify any general-use computer programs used.</p>

<h4><a href="#top" title="Top of page"><img src="img/arrow.gif" alt="" height="10" width="12" border="0"></a> <a name="qualitative"></a>Qualitative studies</h4>
<p>The journal appreciates studies using qualitative methodology, for which a clear exposition of: relationship to existing body of knowledge is important. Data collection as selection, methods of collection, type of data, the relationship of researcher to subjects/settings. Data analysis as the methodological approach and analytic process, with clear definitions of concepts and categories/themes and how these were developed and how they relate to data. Quality and validity of data and analysis as strategies to enhance quality of data, e.g. triangulation, respondent validation. Application of critical thinking to analysis as attention to the influence of the researcher on data collection and on analysis, critical approach to the status of data collected. Applicability for theory development and practice.
</p>

<h4><a href="#top" title="Top of page"><img src="img/arrow.gif" alt="" height="10" width="12" border="0"></a> <a name="references"></a>References</h4>
<p>References should be numbered consecutively in the order in which they are first mentioned in the text. Identify references in text by Arabic numerals in parenthesis as follows: "as shown by Smith (5)":... if two authors; "Smith & Jones (6)";... if more than two authors; "Smith et al. (7)". 
The style of references must follow the Vancouver system and for the abbreviations of journal titles; please consult the List of Journals Indexed in Index Medicus, published annually as a list in the January issue of Index Medicus, also accessible at <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov">www.nlm.nih.gov</a>).</p>
<p>Accepted but still unpublished material should be referred to as &quot;In press&quot;. (References to submitted but not accepted material are not permitted.)</p>

<h4><a href="#top" title="Top of page"><img src="img/arrow.gif" alt="" height="10" width="12" border="0"></a> <a name="tables"></a>Tables and figures </h4>
<p>Material that has been published previously in another publication must be accompanied by a letter from the publisher stating that the authors have permission to reproduce said material.</p>
<p>Tables are to be numbered consecutively with roman numerals. Each table should be typed on a separate sheet and should have a descriptive heading which is self-explanatory. Explain all abbreviations used in a footnote to the each table, or when many abbreviations are used in several tables, refer to the first table where the abbreviations are explained.</p>
<p>All illustrations should be considered as figures. Each graph, drawing, or photograph should be numbered in sequence with Arabic numerals. All figures should have legends, listed on a separate sheet. Each figure should be identified by the name of the journal (JRM), the author's name, and the figure number. In cases where it is not obvious, the top should be indicated. Line drawing and lettering should be large enough to sustain photo-reduction (min 300 dpi).</p>

<h4><a href="#top" title="Top of page"><img src="img/arrow.gif" alt="" height="10" width="12" border="0"></a> <a name="review"></a>The review process</h4>
<p>All manuscripts are first reviewed by one of the Editors. Some papers may be rejected at this stage as they do not meet basic scientific principles or deal with topics beyond the scope of the journal. All other manuscripts will usually be sent to at least two reviewers (within or outside the Editorial Board) with special expertise in the area. The review is not blinded according to the decided policy of the journal. The manuscript will also be sent to a special statistical consultant for evaluation of the statistical methods used and the statistical results, where considered appropriate. After receiving the comments from the reviewers, it will be decided by the Editors whether the manuscript should be accepted directly, which in practice is rare, subjected to a minor or major revision before decision about publication can be made, or rejected at this point. The revised manuscript is usually, if not only minor changes required, reviewed by the reviewers, sometimes including a third reviewer, if there are special reasons, before making the final decision about publication, and if necessary after some further revision. The guidelines to the reviewers can be found on the homepage of the journal <a href="http://www.medicaljournals.se/jrm">http://www.medicaljournals.se/jrm</a>.
</p>
<h4><a href="#top" title="Top of page"><img src="img/arrow.gif" alt="" height="10" width="12" border="0"></a> <a name="page_charge"></a>Page charge</h4>
