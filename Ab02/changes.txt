Review 1:

    Title: Early Integration of Vision and Manipulation
    Authors: Giorgio Metta and Paul Fitzpatrick
    Summary: The authors presented a systematic (or developmental) scheme in
	identifying properties of object by combining casual relation 
	between vision and manipulation/interaction.

    Comments: Overall this paper is well written and well thought-out. 
	I was very pleased to see this new version of abstract, 
	it have been significantly improved.



    - I am inclined towards the original title "Better...".
##
ANSWER: changed to "Better vision through manipulation".
##


    - Apart from (MAYBE) gaining a better model, 
	the arguments for developmental approach need to be highlighted further. 
	Such as, the building blocks idea - bottom up approach etc...
##
ANSWER:
The working hypothesis together with the description of the developmental aspects have been
moved to section 1. We think this improves the paper by stating at the very beginning 
what the model is and what we're trying to demonstrate. We also clarified the description
of table 1 and the idea of causation. This should make clear the developmental aspect of
the discussion.
##


    - The new introduction seem a little odd (especially the very first sentence), 
	not all robots can observes, right?
##
ANSWER: 
The word "observer" has been changed to "bystander".  The point is
simply that robots can take action, and experiment with the world.  The choice of 
the word "observer" was unfortunate, since it implies vision, and as the reviewer
rightly points out, not all robots have this sensory modality.
##


    - Please provide a better presentation of the "three levels of causal complexity", 
	numbering or using similar terms may help (e.g. 1) "sensorimotor coordination"), 
	matching that of Table 1.
##
ANSWER: 
	Numbers have been added to table 1. Table 1 and 2 have been merged into a single table.
##


    - The point made at the end of section 2, 
	"The key to resolving ambiguity..." 
	may be better serviced if highlighted/mentioned a little earlier.
##
ANSWER: 
	Unchanged. It's not really so fundamental having moved the "working hypothesis".
##


    - Section 3 and 4 are nicely written.
##
ANSWER: Thanks.
##

    - Please use a more up to date and accessible reference as well as Brooks et al. 1999. 
	Such as Adams et. al. 2000/1.

##
ANSWER: 
	Added reference to Adams et al. 2000 IEEE intelligent systems.
##


    - I have completely fail to discovery where Table 2 was introduced?

##
ANSWER: 
	Thank you for the remark. Table 2 has been merged w/ table 1.
##


    - Section 6, the stages are nicely presented. However, a better connection 
	to biological processing (if any) need to be stated, otherwise it 
	can be taken to be little misleading with the rest of the paper;

##
I don't think we wanted to be biologically plausible here (not too much at least). 

What I've tried to do is to add a short paragraph in each section to make a link
to "biology". I'm not particularly fond of claiming that what we've done is
biologically plausible...


ANSWER:
A few links were provided in the section "A working hypothesis" now merged into
section 1. In particular the reference to Flanders et al. and Pouget et al.

More details and links between section 6 and section 3 are now provided. Although
this might help in clarifying the biological parallelism we don't think the experiments
described in section 6 are "biologically plausible" in the traditional sense.

1- there's a link now between the detection of contingency betwenn vision and
	motor commands that goes back to Piaget and it is also mentioned in the
	conclusion.

2- localizing the arm using proprioception. We added a description and possibly
	linked it to the activation of VIP-F4 neurons that we described in section 3.

3- reaching is implemented by building a mapping between "gaze direction" and "control". 
	we linked this to section 1 where we mentioned the work of Flanders et al. and 
	Pouget et al.
##


    - the mapping discussed in "Reaching for the object", how does this mapping scheme 
	account for ambiguity/redundancy (if any), in particular, for the case 
	3D mapping? Please discuss...
##
ANSWER:
	We added a paragraph to explain the issue of redundancy. The mapping is not 
	3D but only 2D. Our goal was to reach an object sitting on the table.
##


    - page 10: removing the 'a' may read better, "in this way to be a correctly segmented." -> "in this way to be correctly segmented." or, you need another word after 'segmented', "... a correctly segmented ??.";
##
ANSWER: 
	Fixed. Thanks.
##


    - Is Section 9 really necessary for this paper? Without a ricer context it is 
	difficult to see how this section fit in with the rest of the texts.
	Suggestion: shorten and/or save it for another paper.
##
ANSWER:
We think section 9 is important for the paper. We stated at the beginning of the paper
that we wanted to show how something apparently complicated as "mirror neurons" can be
the result of a developmental process based on much simpler hypotheses. We believe it
represents an additional level of causal understanding (now numbered 3 in table 1).
##


    - Overall this is a great paper, keep up the good work!
##
ANSWER: Many thanks to the anonymous reviewer.
##

Review 2:


 Title: Early Integration of Vision and Manipulation

 Authors: G. Metta & P. Fitzpatrick



2. Are the research goals of this paper explicitly stated and is its terminology easily understandable by a heterogeneous community - including ethologists, computer scientists and roboticists?

                    YES............X...........NO
 Comments:

	The goals could be made more clear. To the author's credit, in section 4, 
	a "working hypothesis" is stated-- "action is required for object recognition 
	in cases where an agent has to develop categorization autonomously". However, 
	this hypothesis is a little lost in the other aspects of the introduction. First, 
	a good deal of neuroscience is covered on pages 3-6 (it took me two readings to 
	process this). While I do think the neuroscience adds to the theory aspect of 
	the paper, this material comes before the "working hypothesis" and caused me 
	some confusion about the goals of the paper. 

###
GENERAL COMMENT:
	We think the organization of the paper caused a bit of confusion and this is
	a good part of the issues raised by the reviewer.
###


###
ANSWER:
	We moved the hypothesis and merged to section 1. We hope this clarifies and
	improves the organization of the paper.

	The additional goal of our paper, perhaps a bit obscured in the text, is to:

	"For the robotic implementation we endeavor to follow the same developmental
	pathway	and exploit the same sort of causal links between actions and 
	sensory feedback."

	we added:

	"We wish to instantiate these results in robotic form to
	probe their technical advantages and to find any lacunae in
	existing models."

	to section 1 to make clear which are the reasons behind our experimenting.
###


	Additionally, while the authors 
	promise on page 1 to "discuss in what sense [their] artificial implementation 
	is ... in agreement with neuroscience" there was no integration of the robotic 
	work and neuroscience background in the conclusion/discussion section. 

###
ANSWER:
	There are now more links in section 6 (now 5). 
###


	Second, 
	a series of developmental phases are proposed on page 6. Are these developmental 
	phases being proposed for humans? Or for the nonhuman primates from which much 
	of the neuroscience data comes? 
###
ANSWER:
	they are proposed for humans and/or for primates. We believed it was clear that 
	we're not at the level of detail [of modeling] to distinguish between the two.
###



	In either case, it would seem better to cite 
	some ethological or psychological data regarding these developmental phases. Is 
	there really a need to speculate about this level of developmental phases at 
	this point in scientific history? 
###
ANSWER:
	We believe we had to show which model we were trying to implement. This
	is the reason of much of the neuroscience data and the description of
	developmental phases. Beside some of the work of Arbib (cited), there's 
	not much of a firmly established model encompassing reaching, manipulation, 
	and object recognition. We don't claim we are providing a very detailed model
	(in fact we didn't even try to do a precise localization of different 
	modules/brain areas - many authors go to that level of explanation). 
	What we wanted to show is how all the pieces fit under the same organizing 
	principle (causation), and roughly, functions/behaviors correspond to
	the activation of a set of brain areas (circuit).

	The new organization of the introduction should make this point clearer.

	We did cite some behavioral studies and little psychological. Having so many
	"direct" evidence from neurophysiology we didn't feel the necessity to 
	include ethological considerations.
###


	One major concern I have about this is 
	the idea that grasping or at least hand motion comes first in their proposed 
	developmental sequence. Perhaps this will be suitable for nonhuman primates, but 
	the motor skills of humans may be relatively slower in development. Much benefit 
	has come in developmental psychology by studying perceptual tasks. 
###
Paul: 
	can we really answer this without rewriting a good deal of section 1 to 4?

PAUL1 it is a good point -- human infants do pretty well perception-wise with very
slowly developing motor control.  Still there may be some work in our favor:
%
Needham, A. (2000). Improvements in object exploration skills may facilitate the development of object segregation in early infancy. Journal of Cognition and Development, 1, 131-156.
%
Needham, A. Barrett, T., & Peterman, K. (in press) A pick-me-up for infants' exploratory skills: early simulated experiences reaching for objects using 'sticky mittens' enhances young infants' object exploration skills. Infant Behavior and Development.
%
I haven't been able to get copies of these citations yet though!


ANSWER:
	this is true and perhaps we should have paid more attention on alternative
	formulations. We were actually arguing in the opposite direction (and perhaps
	we've been a bit biased in this sense): that ACTION is very fundamental
	in case DEVELOPMENT and hence a natural setting is considered.

GIORGIO
ADDITIONAL ANSWER:
	[with more support from the papers you mentioned]
	The neuroscience results we described extensively point towards an alternative
	view where perception becomes something more than just the "input of the system".
	In part perception is thus determined by action and in this sense it needs 
	to follow from action (or sensorimotor coordination for some authors). Of course,
	all these consideration are very debatable - especially whether they're true in
	humans. Additionally we believe that one of the benefits of instantiating 
	a model in a robot is that of validating whether this could be feasible.
###


	This speculation 
	on developmental phases confuses the hypotheses of the paper. Are these 
	"developmental phases" really a description of the steps pursued in the robotic 
	modeling? 
###

ANSWER:
	it is said now in section 1:

	"For the robotic implementation we endeavor to follow the same developmental
	pathway	and exploit the same sort of causal links between actions and 
	sensory feedback."
###


	If so, I think they should be stated as such. Additionally, the discussion 
	and conclusion could more explicitly evaluate the working hypothesis.

###
	TRUE.
###



	Some of the terminology may pose difficulty for this audience. As I mentioned, 
	it took me some time to work my way through the neuroscience. What might help 
	here is to have a little more focus on the working hypothesis, and then work this 
	into the neuroscience section, perhaps putting the working hypothesis before the 
	neuroscience section.
###
ANSWER:
	The paper has been modified as suggested by the reviewer. The neuroscience
	section is a bit long, in our view, in order to describe the results and 
	give a global picture to the reader.
	Perhaps, the way it's presented now, with causation as a guiding
	principle introduced right in section 1 should ease the reading.

	Additionally, we replaced figure 2. Now all areas involved in a particular
	function are more clearly marked.

	Reorganization of tables might also help.
###


3. Are the method(s) described in sufficient detail for readers to understand or replicate the work?

                    YES.......X................NO
 Comments:

	For me, I?d need some more detail on how optic flow was computed and 
	how the correlations were computed to be able to replicate this work. 
	How about a reference to algorithms for each of the optic flow and 
	correlation methods used?

###
Paul: do you have a better reference rather than just adding this.

PAUL1 how about just citing Horn's book?
B. K. P. Horn. Robot Vision. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1986.

GIORGIO: but Horn never mentions correlation based methods, am I right?
	- it's a minor issue though.

ANSWER:

	modified the description of the optic flow algorithm:
	"computed by a generic correlation-based approach over a $16\times
	16$ grid over a $128\times 128$ image at 15 Hz"

	"correlation" is simply to be intended "cross-correlation".
###


4. Does the paper make contact with relevant earlier work in the same scientific area, noting similarities, differences and progress?

                    YES......X.................NO
Comments:

	There is some related work that could have been cited that was not. 
	I just happened to come across the work of Scheier and Lambrinos (1996)
	recently. I think this could be profitably cited.

	Scheier, C & Lambrinos, D. 
	Categorization in a real-world agent using haptic exploration and 
	active perception. In proc. of SAB96 (FROM ANIMALS TO ANIMATS, 
	Fourth International Conference on Simulation of Adaptive Behavior, 
	Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, September 9-13, 1996), p. 65-74

###
Section 10 (9 now).
	There are already examples in robotics of the acquisition of
	object categorization based on this kind of temporally correlated information 
	\cite{scheier-lambrinos-1996}.

ANSWER:
	cited.
###


6. Do its conclusions logically follow from the results obtained?

                    YES........X...............NO
Comments:

	As noted above, the working hypothesis, and neuroscience could be 
	better integrated into the conclusions & discussion.
###
ANSWER:
	NOTANSWERED			

GIORGIO:
	- if we modify the conclusions a bit (for the 4th reviewer) we can also reply to
	this.
###



9. Is it well-organized and well-written?

                    YES...........X...........NO
 Comments:

	I think the organization could be beefed up considerably, and make what is 
	already an interesting paper a better paper. This is notable in the 
	experimental sections, which seem somewhat haphazard in organization at 
	present. Some introductory material at relevant points would be valuable. 
	Section 5 describes Cog, their robotic platform. It would be good to have a 
	paragraph or two here in Section 5 that guides the reader through sections 6 
	through 10, the experimental sections on the basis of their hypothesis. For me, 
	Sections 6 through 10 seem to flow too haphazardly at this point.
###
ANSWER:
	A paragraph has been added as suggested.
###



 	Also, 
	in section 6, the authors start off too quickly with optic flow. I would 
	appreciate a brief consideration of alternative methods and/or at least their 
	rationale for selecting optic flow as a method here.
###
ANSWER:
	NOTANSWERED

GIORGIO:
	- what do you think? Do we need to answer to this? Did we really have 
	  any valid alternative?
###



10. Additional comments:

	The paragraph immediately before Section 4 seems incompletely integrated with 
	the preceding material. For example, the proposal that there is a dorsal to 
	ventral gradient of development seems interesting, and might be better tied 
	into the preceding neuroscience. The idea of probing longer chains needs some 
	elaboration in this paragraph as well.
###
ANSWER:
	it was a rather speculative comment. We preferred to remove the paragraph because
	we cannot really support it appropriately with evidence, a part from 
	looking at the localization of functions in the brain [see figure 2].
###


	At the bottom of page 5, "three main conceptual functions" of what? Of 
	causal understanding?
###
ANSWER:
	sentence changed into:

	We can distinguish three main conceptual functions in the developmental 
	process that leads to object representation (similar to the 
	schema of Arbib et al. \cite{arbib-1981}).
###



	On page 6: "Learning and understanding affordances requires a slightly longer 
	time frame since the initiation of an action (motor command) does not immediately 
	elicit a sensory consequence". Does not immediately elicit ANY sensory consequence? 
	Certainly some proprioceptive consequence will occur. I think what they are 
	saying here is that some of the relevant sensory consequences will be delayed.
###
ANSWER:
	changed into:

	"Learning and understanding affordances requires a slightly longer 
	time frame since the initiation of an action (motor command) does not
	immediately elicit all relevant sensory consequences"
###


	Is page 12 the first use of the term "active segmentation"? If so, perhaps it 
	should be introduced earlier. It seems like a good term. Are the authors the 
	first to use this term?
###
ANSWER:
	The term seems to be used in other contexts, particularly medical imaging.
	It could indeed be a useful term to import to active vision.  It is now
	introduced at the end of the first section.
###

	Section 9?s use of a mimicry task seems to be trying to bite off too much for 
	this paper. The task of object segmentation already seems pretty broad. I know 
	the authors would like to try (as would *Many* others) to tie
	into the current fad of mirror neurons, but, for me at least, mimicry in 
	addition to the main thrust of the working hypothesis of this paper bites off 
	too much.


###
ANSWER:
	We think, this was another misunderstanding due to the organization of the 
	paper. The mirror neuron experiment smoothly integrates with the other examples
	based on causation. We actually started a good part of our experiments with
	that in mind.

	We think that with the reorganization of the introduction and initial sections
	of the paper this stands clearer.

	In fact, there's a full experiment (section 8 now) showing how mirror neurons can be 
	seen as a derivation of "understanding object affordances".
###


	The authors use the term ?causal understanding? without any citation of 
	relevant literature. For example, this term is used at the top of page 6. 
	Citation of work such as:

	Dan Sperber, David Premack, and Ann James Premack (eds.)
	Causal cognition: A multidisciplinary debate
	New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 1995

	would be suitable here.

###
ANSWER: 
	The reference has been added. We were relying on the intuitive meaning
	of causation but of course it's much better to have a proper link.
	Thanks to the reviewer.
###




##############

	The organization of the introduction regarding hypotheses should be 
	improved as should the organization of the experimental sections. The 
	discussion should be revised as mentioned.

	I think this is a very interesting line of research, and this paper has 
	the potential to be very good. I would be happy to comment on the paper 
	again prior to inclusion in the journal.


NOTANSWERED:
	these were general considerations at the end of the review.
	I think we replied extensively enough... :)

Review 3 [PARTIAL REVIEW]

I read pp. 3-5 of Meta and Fitzpatrick. Mostly, it's a reasonable review of 
recent work on cortical systems involved in reaching, grasping, and object 
recognition. However, in the first part of this section, they've made it clear 
that they do not understand the different ideas of Ungerleider and Mishkin vs. 
Goodale and Milner on the functions of parietal and temporal cortex. They attribute 
the dorsal/ventral distinction to Goodale and Milner, when actually it should be 
attributed to Ungerleider and Mishkin. Also, they attribute the idea that the dorsal 
pathway is about "vision for action" to Ungerleider and Mishkin, whereas the idea 
of "vision for action" was developed by Goodale and Milner in response to what 
they saw as a deficiency in U & M's account of the functions of the dorsal 
pathway. Recall that U & M characterized the functional differences between 
the ventral and dorsal pathways as matters of "what" and "where."


###
ANSWER:
	We made a mistake, references and description of the work of U&M vs. G&M was
	wrong. We fixed the issue. Many thanks to the anonymous reviewer.

Review 4:

 Title:  Early Integration of Vision and Manipulation
 Authors: Giorgio Metta and Paul Fitzpatrick



2. Are the research goals of this paper explicitly stated and is its terminology easily understandable by a heterogeneous community - including ethologists, computer scientists and roboticists?

                    YES........X...............NO
 Comments:

The goals are reasonably stated, but not very clear, especially when they are 
swamped under an introduction that is largely of a tutorial nature.  I suggest 
that the article clearly state exactly what has been done in the abstract and in 
the introduction (with more detail).

###
	Do we need to beef up the abstract a bit?

ANSWER:
	We changed substantially the introduction (see also reviewer 2) so
	we believe that now goals and scope of the paper are more reasonably 
	stated at the very beginning.
###



3. Are the method(s) described in sufficient detail for readers to understand or replicate the work?

                    YES...............X.........NO
 Comments:

The work presented is a good example to show how manipulation helps segmentation.  
Since this is an early work, we should not require it to work in an uncontrolled 
setting. However, for the understanding need, I suggest that the paper spell out all 
the major restrictions, about the environment and the task(s).

###
ANSWER:
PAUL2	A summary of the restrictions of the work has been added in the conclusions.
###



4. Does the paper make contact with relevant earlier work in the same scientific area, noting similarities, differences and progress?

                    YES.................X.....NO
Comments:

I like the work presented here, since it argues convincingly and demonstrates 
experimentally the importance of manipulation in infant cognitive development.  
However, the paper should cite the line of recent studies on autonomous mental 
development (AMD) that approaches the principles addressed here in a systematic and 
autonomous fashion, such as the work of Gerald Edelman and Olaf Sprons (manipulation of 
objects to learn its properties, "aversive" or "appetitive") and John Weng (a human 
teacher manipulates objects for autonomous attention and object recognition).

###
	I imagine we should cite AMD and Edelman-Sporns.
	What about making links in the conclusions? It could be a place to
	spell out "major restrictions" :)

ANSWER:
	NOTANSWERED
###


5. Does it make contact with relevant work in other scientific areas?

                    YES..................X......NO
Comments:

The work is motivated well.  I just feel that the material of discussion about 
biological brain (much of Section 3) is of a general tutorial nature and it does 
not link the work presented here specifically.  Any paper about perception and/or 
manipulation can come up with this tutorial section.  I suggest that the material 
be dropped or much condensed into a brief subsection if some is truly intimately related.  
The material is fine for a PhD thesis, but not appropriate for a journal article.

###
	Can you pls check this Paul?

ANSWER:
	We added more links from the presentation of the experimental sections
	to the biological part that make the neuroscience results more relevant. 
	It was intended as a support to our theory rather than just as a 
	tutorial. It is for the benefit of a general audience although we agree
	the paper could have been written differently.
###



What is lacking is a discussion about how manipulation is important to early 
cognitive development in infants and young children and in what ways.  
Such literature is abundant in developmental psychology.

###
	I have to think about this. There's abundant literature. True.
	I wonder if it tells us anything relevant to the paper. Can we leave 
	this for the last minute?

ANSWER:
	NOTANSWERED
###


It is also useful to add a brief discussion about a school of psychology which 
postulates that human children were born with some knowledge about the physical 
world (e.g., Baillargeon, Spelke and others).  The last section alluded to it.

###
	Since we already cited them, what shall we do? And where? More bio
	stuff? It would be too much! What do you think?

ANSWER:
	NOTANSWERED
###



6. Do its conclusions logically follow from the results obtained?

                    YES....X....................NO
Comments:

It is good to discuss the cost of such an approach compared with traditional 
human trial-and-error approach from engineering point of view.  In a controlled 
setting, there have been many studies about object segmentation, which use similar 
ideas (e.g., motion based segmentation) as what are presented here.  A major 
difference between those past studies and what is presented here is that here it 
is the robot who initiates the manipulation, which is not necessarily a part of 
the originally given task.  Then, there is a cost issue.


###
	
ANSWER:
	NOTANSWERED
###



7. Does the paper consider the implications of the approach and outline directions for future work?

                    YES.................X.......NO
Comments:

If it is the programmer to program such manipulations, then the current work and 
the traditional ones fall into the same category in this respect (which is fine).  
However, in other to attack the core of the subject raised by this paper, we must 
address how to enable a robot to autonomously initiate such manipulations in 
uncontrolled settings.  The paper could raise this future research issue.

###
Easy for the conclusions?

ANSWER:
	NOTANSWERED
