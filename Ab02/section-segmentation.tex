Gives a sketch of the min-cut algorithm and how it is applied to
this domain.

A simple example of the graph cut algorithm in operation.  
The left graph represents the output of the point-of-contact 
processing.  Edges in the graphs are weighted by how much
it will cost to split connected nodes.  The bulk of the nodes
are in one-to-one correspondence with pixels in the image.
There are two extra nodes corresponding to the foreground and
background.  The goal is to split the graph into two by removing
edges.  The cost of the split is the sum of the weights on the 
edges removed.  There are good approximate algorithms for
finding a minimum cost solution [ref].

Use 16-connectivity (8 neighbors, plus cells connected by a
``knight'' move).

Cog batting a cube around.  The top two rows show the flipper poking
the object repeatedly from the side, turning it slightly.  The third
row shows Cog batting an object away.  The images in the first column
are frames prior to a collision.  The second column shows the actual
impact.  The third column shows the motion signal at the point of
contact.  The bright regions in the images in the final column show
the segmentations produced for the object.
