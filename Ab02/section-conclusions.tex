\section{Discussion and Conclusions}

In this paper, we showed how causality can be probed at different
levels by the robot.  Initially the environment was the body of the
robot itself, then later a carefully circumscribed interaction with
the outside world.  This is reminiscent of Piaget's distinction
between primary and secondary circular
reactions~\cite{ginsburg78piaget}.  Objects are central to interacting
with the outside world.  We raised the issue of how an agent can
autonomously acquire a working definition of objects. 

In computer vision there is much to be gained by bringing a
manipulator into the equation.  Many variants and extensions to the
experimental ``poking'' strategy explored here are possible.  For
example, a robot might try to move an arm around {\em behind} the
object.  As the arm moves behind the object, it reveals its occluding
boundary.  This is a precursor to visually extracting shape
information while actually manipulating an object, which is more
complex since the object is also being moved and partially occluded by
the manipulator.  Another possible strategy that could be adopted as a
last resort for a confusing object might be to simply hit it firmly,
in the hopes of moving it some distance and potentially overcoming
local, accidental visual ambiguity.  Obviously this strategy cannot
always be used!  But there is plenty of room to be creative here.

The robotic experiments support the view that reaching, grasping, and recognition
can be learnt following a particular ontogenic pathway without the
intervention of an external teacher.
This pathway is consistent with and inspired by what is 
known for biological systems (primates/mammals).
There is relatively little evidence to work with, but it is at least clear that the 
sequence of events leading to object manipulation/recognition cannot take
an arbitrary form unless we assume that some/many of its components are innate.
Although newborns show amazing abilities \cite{spelke-2000} such as early imitation 
\cite{meltzoff-moore-1977}, face detection, etc, there is also evidence 
that the maturation of the brain is far from complete at birth and
complex perceptual abilities require a long time to emerge \cite{kovacs00human}.

%We cannot claim that this is the only possible view but it is certainly one worth
%investigating. Rephrasing Berkeley we can say:
%\begin{quote}
%...objects can only be known by
%\emph{action}. Vision is subject to illusions, 
%which arise from \emph{many different} problems...
%\end{quote}
%[that AI guys know far too well]

%Could relate some of this to the embodied intelligence ideas
%of Brooks... particularly the working hypothesis.
