\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}

Although applied to a simple problem like phoneme discrimination, and on a
limited data set, the work presented in this paper adds evidence of the utility 
of motor information in automatic speech recognition. Also,
the results we present support some of the claims of the motor theory
of speech perception; namely, that speech acts are the real invariant
quantities over speech; and that the phenomenon of coarticulation cannot
be avoided if not resorting to motor-based features.
