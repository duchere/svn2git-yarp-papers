\section{Data set}
\label{sec:dataset}

We work with a a subset of the Contact / Linguometer data
set \cite{tavella}. The data collection setup includes a
\emph{Laryngograph Microprocessor} device (Laryngograph Ltd.,
London \cite{...}) able to gather the speech audio signal
and the electroglottographic (EGG) signal at $16$KHz sampling
rate, and an AG500 electromagnetic articulograph (Carstens
Medizinelektronik GmbH, Germany \cite{...}) able to
record at a sampling rate of $200$Hz the 3D positions of a set
of sensors glued on the tongue, lips and front teeth during
speech production.

The data have been obtained from $6$ female subjects, Italian
mothertongue, while uttering Italian words and pseudo-words,
some of which in interrogative tone. Words were mainly
stress-initial, e.g., /matto/, /nome/, /strada/ (mad, name,
road), and were chosen in order to have several consonants
both at the beginning and in the middle of words, followed
by different vowels and consonants.

The data subset used in this work comprises $77$ words among
those of the Contact / Linguometer data set, namely those containing
/b/, /p/, /d/ or /t/.
