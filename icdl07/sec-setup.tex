The experiments described in this paper were carried out on the robot 
James (see figure \ref{Fig:PicureJames} and \cite{jamone06james} for 
more details). James is an upper body 
humanoid robot which consists of 22 DOFs, actuated by a total of 
23 motors. Torque is transmitted to the joints by belts and 
stainless-steel tendons. The head is equipped with two eyes, which 
can pan and tilt independently (4 DOFs), and is mounted on a 3-DOF 
neck. The arm has 7 DOFs: three of them are located in the shoulder, 
one in the elbow and three in the wrist. The hand has five fingers 
and is under-actuated with a total of 20 degrees of freedom controlled 
by 8 motors. 

The head structure has a total of 7 degrees of freedom, actuated by 8 
motors. Four of these motors are used to independently actuate the pan 
and tilt movements of the left and right eyes. To achieve a more 
human-like motion our strategy was to couple the movements of the eyes. 
We used common tilt $\alpha_t^c$, vergence $\alpha_v^d$ and 
version $\alpha_v^c$. The neck has three degrees of freedom, 
denoted $\theta_y$, $\theta_p$ and $\theta_r$ for yaw, pitch and roll 
respectively.

To summarize, the variables relevant to understand the remainder of the paper
are: the head joints 
$\mathbf q_{head}$ = $\begin{bmatrix} \alpha_t^c & \alpha_v^d & \alpha_v^c & \theta_y & \theta_p & \theta_r \end{bmatrix}^\top \in \mathbb R^6$ and the first four arm joints (3 d.o.f. shoulder and elbow) denoted $\mathbf q_{arm} \in \mathbb R^4$.
