\begin{abstract}
In this paper we discuss the implementation of a precise reaching controller 
on a humanoid robot upper torso. The proposed solution is completely based on a learning 
strategy which does not rely on \emph{a priori} models of the arm 
and head kinematics. The only major simplification is represented by the 
assumption that a visual model of the hand is available (i.e. the robot 
can visually localize the hand). In fact, from a practical point of view, 
the problem of creating a visual model of the hand is a stand alone problem 
which falls outside the scope of this work.
