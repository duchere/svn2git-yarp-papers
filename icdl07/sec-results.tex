\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In this section we report the results of the experiments we carried out
to quantify the performance of the reaching. Following the proposed strategy, 
in order to reach for the 
target we first need to fixate it, i.e. $\utarget = 0$. Using the available sensor (i.e. vision) the best we can do to precisely reach the target is moving the hand to the fixation point, i.e. $
{\uhand} \longrightarrow 0$. Clearly, the image plane distance $\| \uhand - \utarget \|$ can be used as a rough estimate of the reaching precision, i.e. of the Cartesian distance between the target to be reached and the position of the hand. Specifically, assuming infinite resolution of the camera sensor, if $\| \uhand - \utarget\| = 0$ then the hand has exactly reached the target.

\subsection{Open Loop}
The first attempt to reach the target consists in using (\ref{Eq:reaching2})
to choose the arm configuration $\q_{arm}$ which brings the hand to the center 
of the image planes. Clearly, if the forward 
kinematic function (\ref{Eq:forward}) were perfectly represented and if the target were reachable, we would have $\mathbf x_{hand} =  \mathbf x_{target}$, which implies that the target-hand Cartesian distance 
 is null (see Section \ref{sec:reaching} for details). Therefore, in this ideal case, the open loop 
 strategy already results in $\| \uhand - \utarget \| = 0$. In practice, the model 
 (\ref{Eq:forward}) cannot exactly represent the system kinematic\footnote{Part of the representational 
 errors are related to the way we have chosen the represent the kinematic function, in this case the
 so called Receptive Field Weighted Regression model. Part are due to the mechanical plays of the
 kinematic structure.}. Therefore, even tough we can find $\q_{arm}$ such that $\mathbf x_{hand}=
 \hat f_{arm}(\mathbf q_{arm})$ it is not guaranteed that after the movement execution 
 $\| \uhand - \utarget \| = 0$. Figure \ref{Fig:ImagePlaneOpenLoopErrors}
 shows the image plane errors after the execution of the open loop movement. The plot has been obtained
 by fixating a target and performing a series of open loop movements. Each open loop
 movement was different because (\ref{Eq:reaching2}) was solved 
 by choosing a different value $q_{20}$. different value $q_{20}$.

\subsection{Closed Loop}

The residual image plane errors 
due to imperfections in the forward kinematic model can be reduced by a visual closed loop
control strategy. This control strategy moves the arm to progressively 
drive the hand position in the image planes ($\xhand$) to zero. Figures
\ref{Fig:ImagePlaneClosedLoopErrors}, \ref{Fig:TimeResponseClosedLoopErrors}, \ref{Fig:TimeResponseOpenClosedLoopErrors} and \ref{Fig:TimeResponseOpenClosedLoop}  
show how the hand is actually driven to the 
exact image center in both the image planes. The closed loop controller 
improves the accuracy of the reaching movement, but at the cost of a slower 
execution velocity (see Figure \ref{Fig:TimeResponseOpenClosedLoop}). 
Moreover, it is important to notice 
the approximative linearity of the path followed by the hand 
(see Figure \ref{Fig:ImagePlaneClosedLoopErrors}). This linearity denotes 
a good accuracy of the learned Jacobian.
