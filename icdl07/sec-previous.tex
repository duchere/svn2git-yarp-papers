[-] locating an observed object with respect to the robot requires the following data:
		[*] robot forward kinematic (analytical or estimated)
		[*] cameras calibration (self or grid calibration)
		[*] hand-eye calibration 
		
[-] visual servoing requires:
		[*] the manipulator jacobian dx_hand = J(q_arm) dq_arm
		[*] the interaction matrix ds = L(q_head, q_arm) dx_hand
