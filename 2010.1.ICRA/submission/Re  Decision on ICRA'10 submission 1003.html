greetings Vijay,<br>
<br>
I am writing to you about our rejected paper (ICRA2010, submission #1003).<br>
<br>
as you might remember, I had written to you a few days after the
submission deadline showing that we could have possibly submitted a faulty
PDF file of the paper.<br>
<br>
as it turns out by reading the reviews, this is unfortunately the case.
the reviewers were missing essential data for a fair review. as indicated
in the "comments to authors", it also turns out that the paper would
probably be deemed worth publishing, *if* the missing pages had been there.<br>
<br>
at that time you specified that it was not possible to amend the
submission, but that if things had turned out to be like this, we would
have had a chance to correct the submission.<br>
<br>
would you then be prepared to re-send the *full* paper to the reviewers?
in this case I can quickly send you a copy, or re-follow the online
procedure, as it best suits you.<br>
<br>
thank you,<br>
Claudio Castellini<br>
on behalf of all other co-authors<br>

&gt; Dear Colleague:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; We regret to inform you that the contribution identified<br>
&gt; above, for which you are listed as the corresponding<br>
&gt; author, has not been accepted for publication in the<br>
&gt; Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Conference on<br>
&gt; Robotics and Automation, May 3-8, 2010, Anchorage, Alaska,<br>
&gt; USA.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; We received 2062 submissions (2034 papers and 28 videos),<br>
&gt; and only 847 papers were accepted for publication in the<br>
&gt; proceedings. Many potentially strong contributions had to<br>
&gt; be rejected because of a record number of submissions. You<br>
&gt; may log into your workspace at http://ras.papercept.net/ to<br>
&gt; see the reviews for your contribution and associate<br>
&gt; editor's summary. Please note that the Senior Program<br>
&gt; Committee decisions are final. Due to time constraints, no<br>
&gt; discussions on the reviews or the final decision can be<br>
&gt; entertained.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; On behalf of the ICRA 2010 Senior Program Committee and<br>
&gt; Organizing Committee, we would like to thank you for the<br>
&gt; opportunity you have given us to consider your<br>
&gt; contribution. We trust that the current decision will not<br>
&gt; discourage you from submitting your contributions to future<br>
&gt; ICRAs.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The advance program for the conference will be available in<br>
&gt; February 2010 at http://www.icra2010.org. We hope that you<br>
&gt; will be able to join us at ICRA 2010, for what promises to<br>
&gt; be a strong technical program and conference. Please<br>
&gt; consult the website above for further updates about the<br>
&gt; conference.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; We are looking forward to seeing you in Anchorage, Alaska,<br>
&gt; USA from May 3-8, 2010.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Sincerely,<br>
&gt; <br>
