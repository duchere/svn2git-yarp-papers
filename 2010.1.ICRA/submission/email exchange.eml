greetings Vijay,

I am writing to you about our rejected paper (ICRA2010, submission #1003, 
"Joint Visual and Motor Learning for Object Modeling and Recognition").

as you might remember, I had written to you a few days after the submission 
deadline, indicating that we could have possibly submitted a faulty PDF 
file of the paper. as it turns out by reading the reviews, this is 
unfortunately the case. the reviewers were missing essential data for a 
fair review. as indicated in the "comments to authors", it also turns out 
that the paper would probably be deemed worth publishing, *if* the missing 
pages had been there.

at that time you specified that it was not possible to amend the 
submission, but that if things had turned out to be like this, we would 
have had a chance to have the paper re-assessed. for your convenience, I 
attach the mails we exchanged in September.

would you then be prepared to re-send the *full* paper to the reviewers? as 
you can see, it is still in the message we sent you a few months ago; if it 
suits you better though, I can send you a fresh copy or re-follow the 
online procedure.

thank you,
Claudio Castellini
on behalf of the other co-authors

sorry again Vijay,

it seems the previous forwarded message was empty ---- there is no luck for 
us with ICRA this year :-)

please find below the stuff we already sent you in September. this is to 
prove our bona fide, really, you should already have this message (and 
attached paper) in your archive.

thank you again,
Castellini

Dear Claudio,

I do remember the email correspondence on Sept 24. Unfortunately I was =20=

not able to substitute the file because the papers were already =20
committed for review. As I mentioned in my email to you, we had over =20
2200 submissions and had to have a uniform policy about not updating =20
files once the review process started.

I do understand that the 6th page was quite critical for review and I =20=

am sorry the outcome was not favorable.

thank you, it's always good to have someone taking responsibility for an 
accident.

now, what is the program committee going to do to correct the mistake? in 
particular, I guess we are going to get a second review?

since this problem is none of our fault, it would be disgraceful to have 
the paper rejected this way. ICRA being the largest robotics conference in 
the world, I am sure there is an emergency procedure for exceptional cases 
such as this one.

thank you,
Castellini and others

Claudio,

I know it is not your fault but other authors have successfully  
checked their pdf files after uploading them. If you had brought this  
issue to my attention before 9/15 or even within a couple of days of  
the deadline I could have intervened.

I am afraid the review process has concluded and the program has been  
finalized. Again, I regret the unfortunate outcome.

Vijay

Claudio, grazie per il tentativo ma nn credo ci sia niente da fare --se 
puo' servire di consolazione, a me una volta ICRa ha rigettato un paper 
perche' un review era positivo e uno negativo, con quello negativo fatto 
su un altro paper....

il review che ci e arrivato ci da' comunque dei feedbacks interessanti 
per migliorare il lavoro, anche solo con la scrittura. La deadline di 
IROS e' il 28 febbraio, io dico di andare avanti e di pensare a 
risottomettere

ciao -Barbara
