  abstract = {How do we understand the actions of others? According to the direct
	matching hypothesis, action understanding results from a mechanism
	that maps an observed action onto motor representations of that
	action. Although supported by neurophysiological and brain-imaging
	studies, direct evidence for this hypothesis is sparse. In visually
	guided actions, task-specific proactive eye movements are crucial
	for planning and control. Because the eyes are free to move when
	observing such actions, the direct matching hypothesis predicts
	that subjects should produce eye movements similar to those produced
	when they perform the tasks. If an observer analyses action through
	purely visual means, however, eye movements will be linked reactively
	to the observed action. Here we show that when subjects observe
	a block stacking task, the coordination between their gaze and the
	actor's hand is predictive, rather than reactive, and is highly
	similar to the gaze-hand coordination when they perform the task
	themselves. These results indicate that during action observation
	subjects implement eye motor programs directed by motor representations
	of manual actions and thus provide strong evidence for the direct
	matching hypothesis.},

  abstract = {To hit or catch an approaching ball, it is necessary to move a bat
	or hand to the right place at the right time. The performance of
	top sports players is remarkable: positional errors of less than
	5 cm and temporal errors of less than 2 or 3 ms are reliably maintained.
	There are three schools of thought about how this is achieved. One
	holds that predictive visual information about where the ball will
	be at some future instance (when) is used to achieve the hit or
	catch. The second holds that the bat or hand is moved to the correct
	position by exploiting some relation between visual information
	and the required movement. The third focuses on the use of prior
	knowledge to supplement inadequate visual information. For a rigid
	spherical ball travelling at constant speed along or close to the
	line of sight, the retinal images contain both binocular and monocular
	correlates of the ball's instantaneous direction of motion in depth.
	Also, the retinal images contain both binocular and monocular information
	about time of arrival. Humans can unconfound and use this visual
	information, but they are unable to estimate the absolute distance
	of the ball or its approach speed other than crudely. In cricket,
	this visual inadequacy allows a slow bowler to cause the batsman
	to misjudge where the ball will hit the ground. Such a bowler uses
	a three-pronged strategy: first, to deliver the ball in such a way
	as to prevent the batsman from obtaining the necessary visual information
	until it is too late to react; secondly, to force the batsman to
	rely entirely on inadequate retinal image information; thirdly,
	to allow the batsman to learn a particular relationship between
	the early part of the ball's flight and the point where the ball
	hits the ground, and then to change the relationship with such skill
	that the batsman does not detect the change.},
