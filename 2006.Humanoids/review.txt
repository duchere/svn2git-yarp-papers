Dear Dr. claudio castellini:

We are sorry to inform you that your paper entitled

Optimised Support Vector Machines for Robotic Control

was not selected by the program committee to appear at Humanoids 2006.   

The selection process was very competitive. Due to time and space limitations, we could only choose a small number of the submitted papers to appear on the program.  We received 161 valid submissions, out of which sole 100 were accepted, 33 for oral presentation and 67 for poster presentation.

Nonetheless, we still hope that you can attend the conference and get to meet with other researchers working in this quickly growing field. 

We have enclosed below the reviewers' comments for your perusal.


Kind Regards,

Giulio Sandini  and  Aude Billard 
Chairs of the IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots 2006

The main point of the paper is to use Support Vector Machines
to tackle the problem of finding direct and inverse models of 
arm/head/eye systems. The merit of this paper is a survey on three
optimization problem to find the one providing the smallest machine,
while retaining most of the accuracy.

In overall, the paper is well written, the SVM are correctly introduced,
the results on optimization are thoroughly described, but not the
experimentations.

The main idea of learning on-line the direct and inverse kinematic models is
interesting, but this paper needs further experiments and measurements to 
assert its relevancy.

Indeed as the document        is clearly unbalanced spending too much space
introducing SVM, and do not sufficiently described how it fits the 
Humanoid Robotics Conference.

The robotic problem clearly stated is the learning
of direct and inverse kinematics models. But the review on previous works 
is extremly weak: only the paper of  Schaal is cited as a comparison. 
This is very surprising specially as the authors
thanks Giorgio Metta who has also done some contributions on learning inverse
models of arm/head/eye systems together with Fitzpatrick.

They are no discussion or whatsoever in the origin of the problem:
most of the head/arm/eye system does have problems with non-linear errors
induced by the elasticity of the joints. Traditionnal calibration of the camera
might not be sufficient.  In addition to Fitzpatrick, such problem has also
been
addressed in a more traditionnal ways by Thompson and al. in 
"Robotic and Autonomous Systems", vol. "50", pp. "27-40", 2005. 
A comparison with this work would have been appropriate.

Again it would have been more interesting for the authors to decrease the part
dedicated to the introduction of SVM, and to build up on the experimental
parts:
- What is the gain to use Support Vector Machines against traditionnal
inverse kinematic model in vision based behavior ? 
You could use the difference of projection in the image plane between a
classical
approach, the RFWR, and yours.
- Put some numbers (frequency time) on CPU consumption even if it is unfair to
RFWR. Together with the computer characteristics, it would help the reader to
make sure that
your approach is sound for on-line uses as stated in your introduction.

The example problems are too simple to be useful tests. It is not
clear why simple parametric models from kinematic calibration were not
used. SVMs could be used to model the residuals after a parametric fit
if necessary.

The disucssion of SVM regression was too limited. Given that retaining
support vectors is an important part of the approach, a definition of
a support vector in the regression case is needed, as well as a much
more extensive discussion of how SVM regression relates to least
squares regression, given the same basis set. In the least squares
case, it is the faraway points that matter most. Which points matter
most in the SVM case? If a basis transformation is used, this needs to
be clearly described. Is the hyperplane fit once in advance of all
queries,
or is a new hyperplane fit for each query (in which case a discussion of
memory-base/lazy learning approaches is needed)?

It is not clear what is "growing" as more data is given to the
SVMs. Number of data points? The text says only 10 data points are
retained. Number of basis functions? The text needs to describe how
new basis functions are created.  In general a more complete
description of how basis functions are chosen for the example problems
is needed.

The comparision to RFWR is unclear. What is the performance of RFWR in
Fig. 3?

Since the MSE are normalized, it was not clear what level of
performance was actually achieved.

Two of the proposed methods, rejecting closely spaced points and
points that are already predicted well, are common practice in
memory-based/lazy learning.  See Locally Weighted Learning by Atkeson,
Moore, Schaal. 1997.
