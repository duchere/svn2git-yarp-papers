\begin{abstract}
% The abstract should summarize the contents of the paper and should
% contain at least 70 and at most 150 words. It should be written using the
% \emph{abstract} environment.

Multi-modality is a fundamental feature that characterizes biological systems 
and lets them achieve high robustness in understanding skills while coping with
uncertainty.
Relatively recent studies showed that multi-modal learning
is a potentially effective add-on to artificial systems, allowing
the transfer of information from one modality to another.
In this paper we propose a general architecture for jointly learning visual and motion patterns: 
by means of regression theory we model a mapping between the two sensorial modalities improving 
the performance of artificial perceptive systems.
We present promising results on a case study of grasp classification in a controlled setting
and discuss future developments.
