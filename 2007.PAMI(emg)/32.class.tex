Figure \ref{fig:best_class} shows the classification accuracy of the best
models for classification on all $15$ sessions of day $1$ and $2$, for
SVMs and NNs. The analysis detailed in the previous Subsection has
been repeated for the Neural Network. In that case, models $8$ and
$15$ of day $1$, and models $3$ and $10$ of day $2$ have been used to
build the best model.

\end{figure*}

As one can see, there is no clear winner between SVMs and NNs. NNs
perform slightly better on day $1$ (lower mean, lower standard
deviation) but SVMs are analogously better on day $2$. All in all,
classification accuracy is good, at an overall rate of about
$90\%$. In this case, the training data amounts to four sessions
(uniformised in the case of SVMs and full in the case of NNs), which
is about $12$-$15$ minutes of user activity. But notice, that smples
gathered during both days were necessary to have an idea of which
sessions to use.
