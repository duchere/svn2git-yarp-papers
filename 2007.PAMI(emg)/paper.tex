% notes to the reviewers, after producing the camera ready version:
%
% reviewer A
% ----------
%
% - the issue of sensorial feedback has never been in the scope of this
% work, so it would be impossible to deal with it now. nevertheless it
% is an important issue and you might be glad to know that we are
% thinking of starting a project in which bio-feedback is present. so far,
% we have added a reference to this issue in the ``discussion and
% conclusions'' section.
%
% - all other details have been taken into account by completely
% changing the abstract, intro and conclusions section. statements
% you judged too bold have been moderated, and one Figure which was,
% actually, not clear (and not necessary) has been removed.
%
% reviewer B
% ----------
%
% - abstract, intro and conclusions have been almost
% completely rewritten. the ``focus'' of the paper should now be
% clear: this is a preliminary study towards full control of an
% advanced hand prosthesis via EMG. the study was so far conducted on
% a healthy subject to test its feasibility, but of course it now
% needs to be tested upon amputees! we are hopefully going to start a project in
% which a hospital will be involved, and we hope we can, by then, show
% that it actually works.
%
% - the experimental results section, nr. 3, has been largely
% rewritten in order to avoid anecdotical writing; plus, we hope the
% hypotheses tested are clearer now.

\section{Materials and Methods}
\label{sec:m&ms}

In this Section we describe the experiment we have conducted and the
methods we have employed to gather the data, filter and analyse them.

\section{Experimental Evaluation}
\label{sec:exp}

In this Section we describe the experimental analysis. In particular,
we first describe some preliminary results obtained in batch fashion,
which have led to the development of Online Uniformisation (OU). We
then show a detailed comparative analysis of the three approaches
selected, first on the classification problem, and then on the
regression problem, in which OU is used.
