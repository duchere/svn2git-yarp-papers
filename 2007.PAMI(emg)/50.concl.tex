In this paper we have presented a machine learning approach to
joint classification of grasping and regression on the applied force,
using forearm surface electromyography. The approach is totally
non-invasive and easy to set up and use, and it can require as little
as about $15$ minutes of training to achieve good results.

Our experiments, carried out using a Support Vector Machine with
Gaussian kernel, a Neural Network with sigmoidal activation function
and Locally Weighted Projection Regression, indicate that the approach
achieves an average accuracy of around $90\%$ in classification of
grasp types and a normalised root MSE of $10\%$ in prediciton of the
force applied during the grasp. This makes it suitable for driving a
force-controlled mechanical hand.

Future work mainly includes, beside improving the accuracy of the present
system via a better experimental setup, $(1)$ the application of the
approach to the actual control of a mechanical hand; and $(2)$ in the
future, the implantation of the hand on a disabled person with
extensive experiments to test the real usability of the proposed
approach.
