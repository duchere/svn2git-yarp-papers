In the framework of hand prosthetics, it is nowadays possible to build
mechanical hands possessing a fair amount of the abilities required by
the disabled to carry on living in a decent way. Still, a general
sense of frustration impends, as far as \emph{control} of the
prosthesis is concerned: given the current state of the art, it is
basically impossible for the patient to precisely command the
prosthesis what to do.

In this paper, we use machine learning techniques to reconstruct the
hand posture and applied force from the forearm surface
electromyographic (EMG) signal, a particularly cheap, easily set up
and non-invasive technique. We develop an effective tool for dealing
with the well-known bad conditioning of the EMG signal, at the same
time obtaining a remarkable accuracy both while reconstructing the
desired posture of the hand and the desired applied force (a task
which has never been solved in the past so far). The system can be
applied on-line thanks to a simple sparsification strategy which
dramatically reduces the models size at an acceptable loss in
accuracy.
