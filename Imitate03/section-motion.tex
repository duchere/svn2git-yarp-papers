When the robot pokes an object and acquires its segmentation,
it is straightforward to track how the object moves after impact.
%
Pooling this data over all objects reveals how the movement of the
robot's arm~-- which can approach the object from several directions
-- correlates with the final movement of the object.

But not all objects behave the same way when struck.  
Some objects have a preferred direction of motion~-- for example,
a toy car tends to roll forward along its principal axis,
or a bottle might roll along its side.
%
The robot was made sensitive to differences in object motion
conditioned on object identity (color histogram) and 
shape (principal axis).
The robot exhibited what it learned in two ways:
by
attempting to strike objects so that they roll,
and by engaging in
a simple form of mimicry (see Figure~\ref{fig:mimicked-action}).
If the human companion moves an object in a way that
exploited the rolling ``affordance'', 
the robot attempts to do the same; if the human moves the
object in an ``unnatural'' way, the robot attempts to
copy this too.

Basic mimicry.  The first step in mimicking an action is to actually
be able to observe it.  The first sequence shows a human demonstration
of a poking operation.  Frames around the moment of contact are shown.
The object, after segmentation, is tracked for 12 frames using a
combination of template matching and optic flow.  The big circles
represent the tracked position of the bottle in successive frames.
The arrow displayed on the frame of contact ($3^{rd}$ from the left)
projects from the position at the time of contact and at the $12^{th}$
frame respectively.
%
In the second sequence, the bottle is presented to the robot in the
same orientation it had in the demonstrated action and the robot
repeats the observed action, a ``side tap''.  In the third sequence,
the car is presented at a different angle.  The appropriate action to
exploit the affordance and make the bottle roll is now a ``back
slap''.

The sequences on the left show the robot mimicking a human exploiting
a car's rolling ``affordance''.  The sequences on the right show
what happens when the human hits the car in a contrary fashion, going
against its preferred direction of motion.  The robot mimics this 
``unnatural'' action, suppressing its usual behavior of trying to
evoke rolling.
