\section{Introduction}

We begin like this\ldots

And continue by breaking up our sections under sub-headings. We can refer
to papers parenthetically \citep{AB86}, or by direct reference to the work,
as in the next sentence.

\citet{AD94} present some ideas\footnote{And this is what a footnote looks
  like}.

\subsection{A Subsection heading}
The sub-headings themselves can be distributed under sub-sub-headings.

\subsubsection{And one subsubsection heading}

    This would be
    \\
    a
    \\
    figure if I had
    \\
    anything interesting to
    \\
    put here.

  \caption{An example figure}

\subsubsection{Followed by another sub-headings}

\begin{table}[!ht]

    \begin{tabular}{|l|}
      \hline
      Again, I don't \\
      really\\
      \hline
      have anything to\\
      put in here.\\

    \end{tabular}
