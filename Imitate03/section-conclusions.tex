Robots and animals are actors in their environment, not simply passive
observers.  They have the opportunity to examine the world using
causality, by performing probing actions and learning from the
response.  Tracing chains of causality from motor action to perception
(and back again) is important both to understand how the brain deals
with sensorimotor coordination and to implement those same functions
in an artificial system, such as a humanoid robot.
