Imitative behavior requires a mapping between the action of another
and one's own action.  This is a challenging perceptual problem.  We
show how a robot can acquire high-quality perceptual experience
through shared activity.

The robot learns about the
appearance of edges, about object recognition and motion, and about
the appearance of the human hand and its own manipulator.
