Imitative behavior requires a mapping between the action of another
and one's own action.  This is a challenging perceptual problem.  We
show how a robot can acquire high-quality perceptual experience
through shared activity.  
%
There are two kinds of such activity: one
where the human supports the activity (showing, bringing), and one
that can be done either by the robot or a human (cross-role).
