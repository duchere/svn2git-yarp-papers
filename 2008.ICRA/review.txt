From the first reviewer:

The paper presents a machine learning approach for
detecting the grasping type and the magnitude of the
applied force using forearm surface EMG signal of a person
for controlling the DLR prosthetic hand. Although the
accuracy of detecting the grasping type is around 90% which
may not be good enough for practical use, the magnitude of
the grasping force seems to be detected rather well. 
  It is hoped that the authors will present some
experimental results of actual control of the prosthetic
hand in the near future

From the second reviewer:

The experimental results and comparative study between the
various machine learning approaches are well presented with
insights into the viability and strengths of each method.
Below are some suggestions which the authors can consider
for improvement:

1) Page 2, under Data Analysis, was there any comparison
study done on the filtered and non-filtered input signals
in order achieve delay-free result?
2) It would be beneficial for authors to include full
description of the statistical terms used. Eg. LMA
(Levenberg-Marquadt Algorithm). 
3) Page 3, under Training Strategy, uniformisation, it will
be ideal if the objective or rationale behind this
procedure is clearly defined in the first paragraph rather
than directly into the description of the procedure. 
4) Page 5, III.C, for regressions analysis; are there
specific reasons for the selected performance estimators?
5) Page 6, Conclusion, does the 15 mins of training
includes the uniformisation process?
