\section{Introduction}
%
Recent work in developmental robotics has emphasized the role of
action for perception and learning
\cite{metta03early,natale04learning,natale05from}. Developmental
psychology, on the other hand, recognizes that motor activity is of
paramount importance for the correct emergence of cognition and
intelligent behavior \cite{gibson88explore,streri93Seeing,bushnell93motor,hofsten04motor}.
In numerous ways all embodied agents exploit the physical interaction 
with the environment to their advantage. 

In robotics actions like pushing, prodding, and tapping
have been used for visual and auditory perception respectively
\cite{metta03early,etorresjara05tapping}. More articulated
explorative actions or grasping might increase these benefits, as
they give direct access to physical properties of objects like
shape, volume and weight.
%
Unfortunately, all these aspects have not been extensively
investigated yet. One of the reasons for this is that controlling
the interaction between the robot and the environment is a
difficult problem \cite{volpe90real}, especially in absence of
accurate models of either the robot or the environment (as it is
often the case in developmental robotics).
%
The design of the robot can ease these problems. We know for
example that having a certain degrees of elasticity in the limbs
helps to ''smooth''  and control the forces that originate upon
contact. Another approach is to enhance the perceptual abilities
of the robot. Traditional robotic systems in fact have perceptual
capabilities that do not seem adequate for grasping. Haptic feedback in
particular is often quite limited or completely absent. This is
because, unfortunately, most of the tactile sensors commercially
available are inadequate for robotics tasks: they are only
sensitive to forces coming from a specific angle of incidence,
rigid and almost frictionless.

Obrero is an upper body humanoid robot designed to
overcome these limitations \cite{obrero}. It is equipped with series elastic
actuators, which provide intrinsic elasticity and force feedback
at each joint. The hand is equipped with tactile sensors
\cite{etorresjSoft} which provide a deformable and sensitive
interface between the fingers and the objects.

We report a series of experiments where Obrero exploits its
sensing capabilities to grasp a number of objects individually
placed on a table. No prior information about the objects is
available to the robot. The use of visual feedback was voluntarily
limited. Vision is used at the beginning of the task to direct the
attention of the robot and to give a rough estimation of the
position of the object. Next, the robot moves its limb towards the
object and explores with the hand the area around it. During
exploration, the robot exploits tactile feedback to find the
actual position of the object and grasp it. The mechanical
compliance of the robot and the control facilitate the exploration
by allowing a smooth and safe interaction with the object. Results
show that the haptic information acquired by the robot during
grasping carries information about the shape of the objects.

The paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:background}
briefly reviews the importance of haptic feedback for manipulation
in infants and adults. Section~\ref{sec:platform} describes our
robotic platform. Section~\ref{sec:controlling} provides some
implementation details and describes the grasping behavior. The
latter is evaluated in Section~\ref{sec:results} Finally, Section
~\ref{sec:conclusions} draws the conclusions of this work.
