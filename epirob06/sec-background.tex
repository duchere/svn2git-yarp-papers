\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

The tactile sensing in neonates is very poorly known
 in contrast to the visual mechanism\cite{Streti-voir-atteindre-toucher}.
However, tactile sensing provides information to children since
his time in the wound. Hands and arms are intensively used to
learn about their environment even though their motion
capabilities are not completely developed at an early stage.
Moreover, some experiments suggests that in some circumstances
children learn about the objects by tact only, leaving out vision.
For example, \cite{StretiHabituation} placed different objects in
the hand of children who had no visual contact with their hand.
The time that the children hold the object was used to determine
when they habituated to the object. After hand in the object a
number of times the holding time is reduced. When new objets where
presented the holding time increased. This shows learning and
adaptation to novelty. This experiment was repeated with visual
feedback showing the same behavior.
% As shown in the experiment: a
%3D projection of an object was shown to children form....
Integration between the visual and tactile modalities also occurs
at early stages. Tactile information is, for example, used to
confirm visual stimulus as described in the following experiment
\cite{tactileconfirmation}. An image of an object was projected
used polarized lenses so that children wearing ``stereo'' glasses
perceived a 3D object. The children reacted surprised when they
tried to reach it but did not feel the contact when expected. The
children ages were between 6 days to 6 months. Children up to 4
months closed their hand when they were expecting the contact. The
older ones remain with the hand open.

In adults, several studies have revealed the importance of
somatosensory input (force and touch). For example
\cite({Johansson90Liffiing, has studied in detail what feedback
the skin provides to the task of lifting an object and how it is
used to control the movements of the fingers. Highlighting the
importance of this information when human subjects were
anesthetized their fingertips, they have difficulties applying the
right forces to avoid slipping when lifting an object with full
vision (Johansson, 1991).

%Tactile sensing gets information from the object and triggers
%motor responses. This is because the mechanoreceptors, being
%closer to manipulate the object, provide timely mechanical
%information of the interaction between the hand and the
%object\cite{Johansson90Liffiing}. In \cite{Johansson90Liffiing} an
%analysis of the forces observed in the grasp-and-lift task is
%presented. The analysis of many transition phase is mentioned but
%not much data is provided about the initial contact. Which is a
%big problem in robotics\cite{volpe90real}.

Humans use a set of strategies collectively called exploratory
procedures (Lederman and Klatzky, 1987) in their perception of the
world around them, such as tracing object outlines with a finger.
%This has inspired work on robotics.

We address the task of approaching and lifting an object using
tactile feedback to modulate the motor control of the hand and the
arm.


%In robotics exploratory robotics has been developed to do the
%same. Active exploration is needed in unstructured environments.
%(Bajcsy 1989). Humans are very good at extracting propreties of 3D
%objects. Very bad at 2-D compared to Vision. (cite).



%An analog of human sensitivity to thermal diffusivity was
%developed by (Campos et al., 1991), allowing a robot to
%distinguish metal (fast diffusion) from wood (slow diffusion).

%movements of teh receptor-bearing fingers.

%\cite{Johansson90Liffiing} states the importance of teh teactile
%feedback in the motion control of hand. Tactile feedback afferents
%resopnd during mnaipulative tasks (suach lifting). These
%activation are important for the control of manipulation.





%Experimental results suggest that from a very early age, arm
%movements in infants are influenced by vision. For example, van
%der Meer and colleagues found that sight of the hand allows
%infants to maintain the posture of the hand when pulled by an
%external force (van der Meer et al., 1995). Von Hofsten compared
%the arm movements of two groups of infants in the presence and
%absence of an object and found that in the former case arm
%movements were significantly more frequent. When the infants were
%fixating the objects the movements were directed closer to it (von
%Hofsten, 1982). Taken together, these results suggest that in
%children some sort of eye-hand coordination is already present
%soon after birth. But on the other hand, continuous visual
%feedback from the hand is not required for infants to reach for an
%object (Clifton and D.W. Muir, 1993, Clifton et al., 1994). Indeed
%it is only at 9 months of age that children seem to be able to
%exploit visual feedback from the hand during the approach phase
%(Ashmead et al., 1993). A possible explanation for this could be
%that in the first months of development the visual system of
%infants is still rather immature: visual acuity is limited and
%perception of depth has not developed yet (Bushnell and Boudreau,
%1993). Later on during development the role of vision is certainly
%crucial to control the correct preshape of the hand according to
%the object's shape and orientation; however, tactile feedback from
%the contact with an object is an alternative source of information
%that could initially substitute for the visual feedback. In
%adults, several studies have revealed the importance of
%somatosensory input (force and touch); for example human subjects
%with anesthetized fingertips have difficulty in handling small
%objects even with full vision (Johansson, 1991). Humans use a set
%of strategies collectively called exploratory procedures (Lederman
%and Klatzky, 1987) in their perception of the world around them,
%such as tracing object outlines with a finger. This has inspired
%work on robotics. An analog of human sensitivity to thermal
%diffusivity was developed by (Campos et al., 1991), allowing a
%robot to distinguish metal (fast diffusion) from wood (slow
%diffusion).

%The importance of interacting with the world to learn form it has
%been repeatly stated. .. The development of the hand-eye
%coordination has been reported as important for adquiring ... and
%for interacting in the world.


%Contact with objects to extract properties is important. However,
%actual contact with the world has been limited in robotics.
%\cite{volpe90real}, for example, has analyzed the problem of
%impact. That is the first contact were usually the robot switches
%form force control to position control and inestabilyt can be
%presetn. Especailly becaus teh impact produces oscillation that
%make the robto  to operate between the condition s of contact and
%not contact withte table. This nono-linearity makes even more
%possible the inestability.
