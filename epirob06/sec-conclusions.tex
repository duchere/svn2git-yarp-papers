\label{sec:conclusions}


We have shown that a compliant robot hand is capable of safely
reaching toward a object with only a rough idea of its location.
We have demonstrated that a this reaching behavior together with a
exploratory behavior can use the tactile sensing information to
successfully guide the motion of the hand toward a position
adequate for grasping and lifting. We have also shown that the
sensors used respond to the requirements of the task. They detect
the contact with different parts of different objects and increase
the friction for helping the lifting. Finally, we have
demonstrated that the whole behavior does not rely in a prior
knowledge of the object. In short, a robot with the capability of
real interaction with its environment, that is which can gently
act on it and feel it, allows us to successful interact with
unknown objects....



%We have demonstrated a compliant robot hand capable of safely
%coming into contact with a variety of objects without any prior
%knowledge of their presence or location the safety is built into
%the mechanics and the low level control, rather than into careful
%trajectory planning and monitoring. We have shown that, once in
%contact with these objects, the robot can perform a useful
%exploratory procedure: tapping. The repetitive, redundant,
%cross-modal nature of tapping gives the robot an opportunity to
%reliably identify when the sound of contact with the object
%occurs, and to collect samples of that sound. We demonstrated the
%utility of this exploratory procedure for a simple object
%recognition scenario. This work fits in with a broad theme of
%learning about objects through action that has motivated the
%authors' previous work (Fitzpatrick et al., 2003). We wish to
%build robots whose ability to perceive and act in the world is
%created through experience, and hence robust to environmental
%perturbation. The innate abilities we give our robots are not
%designed to accomplish the specific, practical, useful tasks which
%we (and our funders) would indeed like to see, since direct
%implementations of such behaviors are invariably very brittle;
%instead we concentrate on creating behaviors that give the robot
%robust opportunities for adapting and learning about its
%environment. Our gamble is that in the long run, we will be able
%to build a more stable house by building the ground floor first,
%rather than starting at the top.
