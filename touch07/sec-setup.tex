\section{Experimental Setup} 
%
The setup used in these experiment is called Obrero \ref{ObHardware}. 
Obrero is an upper 
torso humanoid with a head, an arm and a hand. The head is simple
two degrees of freedom (DOF) pan-tilt structure, on top of which 
there is a video camera. The arm has 7 DOFs, 4 in the shulder and 
three at the wrist. The hand has three fingers, that we will call 
thumb, index and middle. Both the hand and the arm are equipped 
with series elastic actuators, which provide torque sensing and 
intrinsic elasticity to the joints. Tactile feedback is provided 
to the robot by 40 sensors, 8 on each fingers and 16 on the palm 
(see \ref{ObHardware}).

Might need to add citations to DOMO.
Add citation to SEA.
Add explanation/ref to finger's SEAs (they are on the figure).
