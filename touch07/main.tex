\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Many of the useful tasks, that humans do, involve the use of their
hands to manipulate objects. We control our hands very dexterously
in a variety of environments daily. However, state of the art
robots are very limited at the moment of manipulating the same
kind of objects in similar environments. For instance, a robot can
precisely position a part, but it is not capable of picking up
objects from a box or even grabbing an object from a table. Part
of the reason for that limited performance of robot manipulation
is the current approach that relies in a prebuilt model of the
environment and a precise arm. Here, we present an alternative and
effective approach to manipulation that we call sensitive
manipulation. This approach uses massive sensing and a compliant
hand to actually come in contact with the objects to manipulate
specifically and the environment in general. As a result, the
robot Obrero, is capable of reaching for unknown objects, reorient
its hand to grab the object, apply enough force to avoid slippage
when moving the object and place an object in a surface. These
operations are done using mainly tactile feedback and they are
adaptive to object shapes and surfaces. Besides, it is greatly
reduces the computation needed in comparison to a traditional
approach. Thus, Sensitive Manipulation, makes possible for robots
to be more dexterous and adaptive when manipulating objects[fisrt
