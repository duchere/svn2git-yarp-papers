In this section we report the experimental evaluation of OISVMs
to the scenario of place recognition, where the aim is to update
the model to handle variations in an indoor environment.

As a
simple case-study, we first test the method on a set of databases
commonly used in the machine learning community

OISVMs have been implemented in Matlab and tested against LIBSVM v2.82
\cite{ChangL01}. For the sake of comparison, LIBSVM has been modified
as suggested by the Authors in order to set $p=2$ in
(\ref{eqn:svm_primal}); this modified version is called LIBSVM-2 in
the following.  The software library was also extended to various
families of kernels, and to two approximate incremental extensions of
SVM, the fixed-partition incremental SVM \cite{syed99incremental}, and
the memory-controlled incremental SVM \cite{pronobis:icvs06}.
The kernels used are infinite-dimensional, so we show curves for various
values of $\eta$.
