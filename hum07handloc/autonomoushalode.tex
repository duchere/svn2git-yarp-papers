                        % This package allows you to substitute LaTeX

                        % you wish to use this capability because it works
                        % via some PostScript tricks. Alternatively, the
                        % graphics could be processed as separate files via
                        % psfrag and dvips, then converted to PDF for

%\usepackage{stfloats}  % Written by Sigitas Tolusis
                        % Gives LaTeX2e the ability to do double column

                        % possible in LaTeX2e). This is an invasive package
                        % which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e output
                        % routines. It may not work with other packages that

                        % Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
                        % that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
                        % that authors should try to avoid such use.
                        % Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or
                        % midfloat.sty package (by the same author) as IEEE
                        % does not format its papers in such ways.

                        % preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline

%	by considering an object manipulation scenario and by explicitly
%	taking into account embodiment, interaction and the exploitation
%	of smart design solutions. The robot is equipped with moving eyes,
%	neck, arm and hand, and a rich set of sensors, enabling proprioceptive,
%	kinesthetic, tactile and visual sensing. A great deal of effort
%	has been devoted to the design of the hand and touch sensors. Experiments,

%	the quality of the robot perceptual capabilities.},
