% Text of abstract

Robot projects are often dead ends, in that the software 
and hardware they produce disappear without trace.
This is true for all sorts of projects, but it is
particularly true in robotics since our work may be
tied to uncommon hardware and a small group of users.
Humanoid robotics is currently in exactly this condition,
leading to a lot of ``churn''.

In this paper, we explore how best to connect our software with the
mainstream, so that it can be more stable and long-lasting,
without compromising our ability to constantly change our
sensors, actuators, processors, and networks.  We also look
at how to enable propagation of our hardware designs to
interested parties.

We focus on how to organize communication between sensors, processors,
and actuators so that loose coupling is encouraged, making 
gradual system evolution much easier.  We develop a model of 
communication that is transport-neutral, so that data flow
is decoupled from the details of the underlying network(s) and protocol(s)
(thus allowing those details to change, as they often do).
%
We develop a methodology for interfacing with devices (sensors,
actuators, etc.) that again encourages loose coupling and can make
changes in devices less disruptive.
%
We discuss the problem of incompatible
middleware, and how we are doing our part to avoid it.
%
We emphasize the utility of the Free Software approach to software
distribution and licensing, and specifically the benefit it brings to
small communities with idiosyncratic requirements.
%
%We enumerate the advantages participation in the
%Free Software community offers to a research field
%that could otherwise be isolated.
%


Of course, it would also be better if humanoid robot software had
larger number of users with similar hardware, and we're doing our part
to encourage this by releasing the design of our iCub humanoid under a
free and open license, and funding development using this platform.


%this  community can give
%a considerable cost reduction, since mutual  granting of free and
%open-source licenses leads to less duplication  of engineering effort.
%
%We describe YARP.  YARP offers solutions to basic 
%Goes here.  Key point: we're a long way from standards that
%make novel robots look the same.
