% Text of abstract

Software is unlikely to survive for very long if it is
tied to uncommon hardware or a small group of users.
Humanoid robotics is currently in exactly this condition,
leading to a lot of software ``churn''.
%
In this paper, we explore how best to connect our software with the
mainstream, so that it can be more stable and long-lasting,
without compromising our ability to constantly change our
sensors, actuators, processors, and networks.

We focus on how to organize communication between sensors, processors,
and actuators such that they remain decoupled and replaceable.
We emphasize the importance of the Free Software approach to software
distribution and licensing, and the benefit it brings to small
communities with idiosyncratic requirements.
%
%We enumerate the advantages participation in the
%Free Software community offers to a research field
%that could otherwise be isolated.
%
We discuss the importance and difficulty of creating 
repositories of drivers.

We believe that the physical design of humanoid robots


We acknowledge the value of common hardware platforms,
and discuss our open source design for the iCub humanoid.

%
%We describe YARP.  YARP offers solutions to basic 
%Goes here.  Key point: we're a long way from standards that
%make novel robots look the same.
