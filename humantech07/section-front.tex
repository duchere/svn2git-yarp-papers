\begin{abstract}
% Text of abstract

Software is unlikely to survive for very long if it is
tied to uncommon hardware or a small group of users.
Humanoid robotics is currently in exactly this condition,
leading to a lot of software ``churn''.
%
In this paper, we explore how best to connect our software with the
mainstream, so that it can be more stable and long-lasting,
without compromising our ability to constantly change our
sensors, actuators, processors, and networks.

We focus on how to organize communication between sensors, processors,
and actuators such that they remain decoupled and replaceable.
We emphasize the importance of the Free Software approach to software
distribution and licensing, and the benefit it brings to small
communities with idiosyncratic requirements.
%
%We enumerate the advantages participation in the
%Free Software community offers to a research field
%that could otherwise be isolated.
%
We discuss the importance and difficulty of creating 
repositories of drivers.


Of course, it would also be better if humanoid robot software had
larger number of users with similar hardware, and we're doing our part
to encourage this by releasing the design of our iCub humanoid under a
free and open license, and funding development using this platform.
Among other benefits to individual projects, 


%this  community can give
%a considerable cost reduction, since mutual  granting of free and
%open-source licenses leads to less duplication  of engineering effort.
%
%We describe YARP.  YARP offers solutions to basic 
%Goes here.  Key point: we're a long way from standards that
%make novel robots look the same.
