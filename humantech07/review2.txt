Main Contribution of the Paper:

The main contribution of this paper is to describe the realization of
an open humanoid platform. This concern the software part called YARP
and the hardware called ICub. The latter one is sayed to be open
because all the blueprints are available through the web-page of the
project. 

 * In fact, the claim is stronger; we claim the platform is free and
 open source not only because the designs are available publically,
 but because those designs are available under a free and open
 license that permit, for example, redistribution of modified forms,
 and commercial exploitation of any form that preserves the granted
 freedoms.

This project is funded by the european community and is
spanned over 5 years. It aims at providing 10 research platforms to be
freely distributed in the european community. The author also stress
that their architecture deals with incompatible architectures and
frameworks.

This is realized through an abstraction of the hardware, and a loose
communication architecture.

Specific Comments to Authors:

The quality and the scale of this open project is highly remarquable,
and the effort provided by the authors is consequent. It is specially
true for the hardware part, which should be more detailled. You should
give more details for instance regarding the position of the sensors
you plan to put on the robot. 

 * For that we prefer to use a citation, rather than insert all
 those details in this paper.

Regarding the scientific aspect, you
should stress more the relationship between the structure of your
system and the cognitive aspect of the research. They are strong
constraint related with highly dynamic system such as humanoid and
their software architecture. Most notably the low-level motor-control
loop. This will call for specific application structure which sadly do
not appear here.

The presentation of YARP stay painfully at the computer science level
without having a nice leverage. 

 * It is not clear what the term leverage means in this case; the
 overall point is well taken.

The cited paper of the authors is much
better than this presentation. The position of YARP related to the
others robotic systems is much better. The two parts put forward in
the present paper are the use of generic device object and network
communication. 

The notion of Hardware Abstract Layer is pretty old,
and it is not clear what is the advantage of YARP over the other
systems which implements also a HAL systme such as MARIE. 

 * We agree that the idea of a hardware abstraction layer has
 been around for almost as long as computer science.  It is a
 good idea.  It can be done well or badly.

The second
point related to network communication might be usefull for teaching
purposes, but as stated by the authors in [11] CORBA based solutions
are much more powerful. 

 * CORBA based solutions introduce a level of complexity which we 
 choose to avoid.  It can be difficult to intregrate CORBA solutions
 with other middleware.

The description of the network protocole is
really not at its place, what is the point? 

 * Network protocols done well facilitate progress.  Done poorly they
 impede progress.  A key differentiating point between YARP and other
 systems is that data can be successfully sent or received to YARP
 modules from non-YARP modules with almost trivial simplicity.
 This is entirely a function of careful design of the network 
 protocol.

In the other hand iCub
could have been more described. Why don't you describe the modules
already avaible or planned with YARP allowing the emergence of
cognitive capabilities, and which makes YARP unique.


For instance, you use ACE p.4, but not TAO from the same group. Why
don't you justify this choice ? Real-time corba such as ORBIX are now
used in humanoids robots such as HRP-2. 

 * [We should add a critique of CORBA etc]

They are also other highly
efficient CORBA implementation which are very suited to soft real-time
such as omniorb and which are free. Such kind of technology is used in
desktop environment such as gnome and kde.

In the overall, this paper give the impression that it could be improved.
