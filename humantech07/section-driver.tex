\section{Devices and Drivers}
Code reuse becomes difficult at the level where algorithms 
communicate with the low-level hardware. The OS layer of YARP tries 
to minimize dependencies between algorithms and the hardware for 
which we define a constant interface (threading, 
memory, network, filesystem). Unfortunately more specific hardware 
(motor control boards and frame grabbers are popular 
examples) requires a more sophisticated mechanism. In these 
cases vendors provide device drivers and a set of APIs to the user.
The API comes in the form of a static or dynamic 
library which is linked to the user's code. Unfortunately
APIs vary a lot even within devices that belong to the same family. 
Even worse the API of the same hardware may vary on different 
operating systems or change on future releases of the hardware. User 
code becomes dependent on the particular board for which it was initially 
developed and bound to the decisions and assumptions of the vendor. For 
example vendor A might decide to use integers to represent the position 
of a motor joint, wheras vendor B might decide to use a floating point
variable. Otherwise interchangeable devices may have different ``initialization'' 
procedures. Consider for example a motor control board which has a serial
interface to the host computer; the API of this board will probably require 
that some parameters (port number, baud rate, number of data bits, etc) are 
specified when the device is created. Suppose now that we obtain a more 
recent release of the same board that now has a USB interface. In this 
case the parameters to initialize the board are different and we are forced 
to rewrite all processes that use it (the situation is 
represented in Figure~\ref{fig:devices1}). 

We call devices which can only be accessed using vendor 
supplied material ``sticky devices'' 
because they tend to make the particular set of assumptions chosen by 
the vendor stick to the user's code. A logical step in such a situation 
is to wrap the functionality supplied by the vendor in a facade, so that 
source code dependencies are reduced. In YARP wrappers can be 
made individually, compiled and built separately, and optionally used 
across the network. This mechanism produces a level of separation between 
device-specific code and user code that is effective for ``quarantining'' the 
sticky devices. This is achieved in three ways: (i) definition of interfaces 
for families of devices (ii) localization and separation of device 
initialization and creation (iii) creation of network wrappers and separation 
between devices and communication. 

Note that when we talk about ``interfaces'' here we do not refer to
the interface description languages (IDLs) used in CORBA and other systems,
but simply to a consistent API in C++.  
%
We avoid using IDLs because they impose extra constraints on the user's
toolchain.
%
Concerns related to
communication are addressed in point (iii), not (i).  We keep
communication and device interfaces separate, so that users can
exploit one and not the other as they wish, and also code written to
use a device remotely can later be made local with only a cost of a
single extra virtual method call compared to calling the vendor's API directly.
This is important so that users do not need to go through a painful
porting process if they discover at some point that remote operation
is too slow for their application~-- for example, an implementation
of inertial-driven stabilization eye movements (the so-called vestibular-ocular reflex)
might require a very tight loop between sensors and motors.

%the vestibular-ocular reflex might require a very tight loop
%between sensors and motors.


\subsection{Device Interfaces}
An interface to a YARP device is the specification of the functionalities
it provides. In practice in C++ an interface is a virtual base class, whose 
member functions define the ensemble of  functionalities a device must 
implement in order to provide that interface.  A YARP device is a 
``wrapper'' class which implements all methods declared in its interface. 
A single device can of course expose more than a single interface 
(in C++ this is implemented through multiple
inheritance). All details specific to the hardware 
(vendor's API and library) are handled in the wrapper class and are 
hidden behind its interfaces. 
The idea is that changes in the hardware are caught by the wrapper class 
and never propagated to the user code. As a result, if interfaces are 
well designed, the impact on the code due to hardware change is minimized. 
%
Of course, unique features of a device can be exposed in a new interface,
but without much benefit over using the vendor's code directly for that
specific feature.  And any code written using that novel interface will
need to be reworked if another device is substituted.

As discussed previously, initialization parameters may introduce annoying 
dependencies in the user's code. To solve this we have defined a common 
interface to all devices (the 
\emph{DeviceDriver} interface) which normalizes how devices are initialized
and un-initialized, and, more importantly, how initialization parameters 
are passed to them. In particular this interface defines two methods:
\begin{verbatim}
  virtual bool open(yarp::os::Searchable& config)=0;
  virtual bool close()=0;
\end{verbatim}
This \emph{open} method initializes the device. Initialization parameters 
are passed to the function as a (typically nested) list of key-value entries 
represented as a \emph{Searchable} object.
A \emph{Searchable} can contain all 
possible parameters that devices might require for initialization. Initialization 
parameters for devices 
are stored in ``.ini'' files (again in the form of a list of key-value 
entries).
A process that wants to open a device reads 
the file and transfers its content into a \emph{Searchable} object. 
This class
plays a role in YARP similar to that of the {\em ConfigFile} class in Player/Stage,
except generalized to work for
 parameters expressed as command line arguments, or
passed across the network, or created in a GUI, etc. -- we abstract
across all the possible sources of configuration settings.
The configuration
object is passed to the device through the \emph{open} function. 
It is worth stressing that up to now this procedure is totally device 
independent, because the parameters are just copied and not interpreted 
by the process. It is only in the implementation of the \emph{open} method 
(in the wrapper class of the device) where the \emph{Searchable} object 
is parsed to extract the parameters that will be used to inizialize the 
device.  The \emph{Searchable} object is designed so that it can
collect information about how it is used, yielding some basic
documentation about the parameters relevant to a given device.

The \emph{close} method performs all the operations required to shut down 
the device properly and release all the resources it was using. No
parameters are required by this function.

\caption{Interfaces allow code reuse. VABoard and VBBoard (see 
Figure (\ref{fig:devices1})) now implement
the same interfaces (through their respective wrapper classes). The user's 
code accesses the hardware through these interfaces and is not aware of 
the details of how the methods are actually implemented. The different 
initialization parameters are listed in configuration files and are thus 
separated. VABoard and VBBoard are now completely interchangable.}
\label{fig:devices2}
\end{figure}

%%% new paragraph
YARP also defines interfaces to board families of devices, like 
frame grabbers or motion control boards. Overall interfaces 
captures similarities among devices and allows separating device 
dependent code from user code. To the extent that user code uses 
interfaces shared by other devices, another device can be substituted 
later without change to that part. This includes devices with different 
initialization procedures, or different APIs (see Figure~\ref{fig:devices2}).  
Devices can also be nested or assembled into composite structures if necessary.

%%% the above paragraph now subst the following 
%% YARP defines interfaces to broad families of devices. For example this 
%% is a partial list of the interfaces defined for generic devices that 
%% generate a stream of color images (frame grabbers):

%% \begin{itemize}

%% \item \emph{IFrameGrabberRgb}, methods in this interface 
%% provide access to the most recent frame acquired by the device, and 
%% information about its size (number of columns and rows);

%% \item \emph{IFrameGrabberControls}, specifies a set of functionalities 
%% to control how the device performs the acquisition, like shutter speed, 
%% brightness and gain.

%% \end{itemize}

%% Interfaces to motor control devices are more difficult to define. 
%% Control 
%% boards designed for industrial applications have often a quite standard 
%% interface which provides a PID control algorithm and position or velocity 
%% control modes. Things become more complicated when we consider also 
%% programmable devices that can implement virtually an infinite set of 
%% functionalities and control algorithms. 
%% For this reason interfaces to control boards have been defined on the basis 
%% of the control paradigm they implement. Accordingly, YARP defines:

%% \begin{itemize}

%% \item \emph{IEncoder}: group all methods providing access to the motor 
%% encoders, like methods for reading the current position and velocity of 
%% each axis;

%% \item \emph{IPositionControl}: methods to control each axis 
%% by specifying its position;

%% \item \emph{IVelocityControl}: methods to control each axis 
%% by specifying its velocity;

%% \item \emph{ITorqueControl}: methods to control the amount of 
%% force/torque exerted by each axis.

%% \end{itemize}

%% These last interfaces are independent of the particular algorithm the 
%% control board implements to realize the corresponding functionality. 
%% These details are delegated to specific interfaces. For example 
%% \emph{IPidControl} includes methods to interface to a PID controller, 
%% such as for example to read or set the values of the gains.

%% To summarize, interfaces captures similarities among devices and 
%% allows separating device dependent code from user code. To the 
%% extent that user code uses interfaces shared by other devices, 
%% another device can be substituted later without change to that part. This 
%% includes devices with different initialization procedures, or different
%% APIs (see Figure~\ref{fig:devices2}).  Devices can
%% also be nested or assembled into composite structures if necessary.

\subsection{A factory of devices}
Encouraging device access through 
interfaces achieves a good level of separation between vendor/device 
specific APIs and user level code. Interfaces alone, however, do not 
guarantee a complete level of separation. In practice users must still 
specify the type of device they want to create. Care must be taken to 
avoid  this introducing unwanted coupling between device specific code and 
user code. A common software 
engineering practice is to \emph{localize object creation} so to 
minimize the amount of code that is responsible for object creation 
and initialization. 
We have seen that in YARP part of this is realized by the 
\emph{DeviceDriver} interface, which encourages all initialization procedures 
to be performed inside a standard \emph{open} method. 
We then go one step further, and encourage device creation to be
delegated to a \emph{factory}. The \emph{factory} contains a list of 
all devices available in YARP and the corresponding functions to call 
to create them. It receives a list of initialization parameters, 
creates the device, and initializes it 
through the \emph{DeviceDriver} interface (this is similar to
the \emph{DeviceTable} in Player).
If the process is successful
a valid pointer to the device is returned. This pointer is the only 
``access point'' to the device and (via dynamic casts) its interfaces.
%
%Other interfaces can 
%be obtained by casting this pointer to the appropriate virtual class 
%(in C++ this can be safely done through dynamic cast). 
%

%% -- removed to address reviewers' comments
%%The whole process of creation, initialization and interface access is 
%%managed by the \emph{PolyDriver} object. 
%%Under good ``portable'' usage in YARP, the user accesses devices
%%via \emph{PolyDriver}, asking for their
%%creation through the \emph{PolyDriver::open())} method. 
%%
%%
%%This works just the same as the \emph{open()} method we
%%talked about for specific devices, except now our configation
%%object (read from file, command line, network, GUI, etc.)
%%specifies which device we want as well as all its options.

%% }\label{fig:devices4}
%% \end{figure}

%% \subsection{An example: accessing a motor control board}
%% For example suppose we want to use the {\tt test\_motor} device. In 
%% YARP this is a fake device which simulates a control board for
%% testing purposes. This device supports the \emph{IPositionControl} and 
%% \emph{IVelocityControl} interfaces. To begin with, we first create an 
%% instance of the \emph{PolyDriver}. The actual device is create by 
%% calling the \emph{PolyDriver::open()} method specifying the symbolic 
%% name of the device ({\tt test\_motor}):

%% \begin{verbatim}
%%   PolyDriver device;
%%   device.open("test_motor");
%% \end{verbatim}

%% We could also be more specific and pass in configuration options,
%% but we keep things simple here.
%% Now we can get the interfaces we want from our {\tt test\_motor} 
%% by calling the \emph{PolyDriver::view()} method:

%% \begin{verbatim}
%%   IPositionControl *ipos=NULL;
%%   device.view(ipos);

%%   IVelocityControl *ivel=NULL;
%%   device.view(ivel);
%% \end{verbatim}

%% Checking if {\tt ivel} and {\tt ipos} are non-NULL assures us that 
%% {\tt test\_motor} really supports the respective interfaces.
%% This is reminiscent of the treatment of interfaces
%% in something like DCOM, but is grossly simplified,
%% implemented directly with the C++ type system so
%% that we can be just one virtual call away from
%% the native device API.
%% %
%% We can now call methods of the \emph{IPositionControl} interface to 
%% (for example) move 
%% joint number $0$ to the angular position of $40deg$, with the velocity 
%% of $5\frac{deg}{s}$ and acceleration of $100\frac{deg}{s^2}$:

%% \begin{verbatim}
%% ipos->setRefAcceleration(0, 100);
%% ipos->setRefSpeed(0, 5)
%% ipos->positionMove(0, 40);
%% \end{verbatim}

%% %
%% (The use of degrees rather than radians in YARP interfaces
%% is part of a bias towards keeping all data as human-readable
%% as possible.)
%% %
%% Or we could use the \emph{IVelocityControl} interface to move axis 1
%% at a smooth velocity of $5\frac{deg}{s}$, accelerating to
%% that velocity at $100\frac{deg}{s^2}$:

%% \begin{verbatim}
%% ivel->setRefAcceleration(1,100);
%% ivel->velocityMove(1, 5);
%% \end{verbatim}


%% The same code would do something for all of the motor devices we
%% have that implement these interfaces.  The details might vary
%% a bit but in principle the overall behavior should be consistent.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Device Remotization: Network Interfaces}
%
A final level of separation is achieved by supporting device remotization,
or operation across the network via proxies.
This feature is desirable for many reasons. It 
allows separate compilation and
execution of different parts of the system, to avoid (for example)
 the existence of motor control libraries on just a single OS
constraining you to also do image processing on that same OS.
It makes distributed processing easier, letting you shift
processing to extra machines when the load becomes high.
%
Remotization is in practice one of the major benefits offered by
YARP and Player.  They achieve that goal in somewhat different ways.
In Player, devices are responsible for producing their own messages
(represented as a C structure, with the Player library responsible for
marshalling/de-marshalling).
%
In YARP, message production is done at the level of device {\it families}.
%
The use of standard YARP APIs for families of devices
makes it straightforward to substitute in a proxy
instead of a local device.
%
% Knowledge of whether a process is accessing 
%a given device locally or remotely would clearly limit this flexibility, 
%because it would force modification in the code of the process itself. 
%
By using YARP ports for communication, with their defined protocols,
remotization also gives us portability across different platforms, as 
it naturally defines a network interface that can 
be used to make resources available on one platform to processes compiled 
and running on a different one. This decouple the compilation, build 
environment, libraries, operating system and language dependencies of 
hardware and user software.

The remotization mechanism relies on the communication layer 
(see Section~\ref{sec:transporting}) and on two 
\emph{Network Wrapper} devices, 
one acting as a \emph{Server} and the other acting as a \emph{Client}. 
Both network devices implement the very same interface of the device 
they wrap: the only difference is that they 
do not connect directly to the hardware but act as network proxies, 
talking to each other using a predefined protocol, which involves one or more 
YARP Ports configured for RPC and/or streaming
as the nature of the device dictates (see Figure~\ref{fig:devices3}).

A process that wishes to connect to the remote device using
the YARP code-base
creates an instance of the \emph{Client Network Wrapper}
(the YARP code-base could be avoided by working with the network
protocol directly, as described in Section~\ref{sec:transporting}).
%
This wrapper exports 
exactly the same interface of the 
``wrapped'' device so the process can pretend that it is connected to 
a real device. The \emph{Client Network Wrapper} converts calls from 
the process into messages, sends them to the other end of the 
communication link, and, in case a reply is expected, waits for data and 
dispatches it to the calling process. 
%
The \emph{Server Network Wrapper} waits for incoming connections from 
the network. 
In addition it creates an instance of the wrapped 
device to which it forwards requests from the network. If requests
involve a reply theses are sent back to the 
calling port so that they are received by the remote client. The 
\emph{Server Network Wrapper} gains access to the local device through its 
interface; as such it is a total independent 
entity that can be reused for devices of the same family.
%
%The responsibility of the \emph{Network wrappers} 
%is to perform the marshalling and de-marshalling of the 
%information that travels through the network, so that it is correctly 
%interpreted by distinct platforms (this is required for systems in which 
%data is represented with different standards).
