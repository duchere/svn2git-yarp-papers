Lorenzo?


\begin{itemize}


\item Summarize argument that, long term, free software approach 
is better for supporting devices especially with smaller user
bases, obsolescence.


\item Driver access in C/C++ with minimal bureaucracy -- no
entanglement with communication/middleware.  When operating
on a single machine, if the user wishes, operation without
transport or marshalling/demarshalling should be possible, ideally
direct C/C++ calls.

\item Ideally, drivers would be expressed in a form that
can be ``ripped out'' of any library or framework in use
with minimal hassle.

\item Similarly, a communication/middleware mechanism that is 
not tied up with the notion of drivers.

\item A communication/middleware mechanism that is transport
neutral, only depending on broad outline of services.


\end{itemize}
