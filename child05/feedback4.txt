Fitzpatrick, Needham, Natale, & Metta1. Page 2: I'm not fully following the rationale in the following-	"The feasibility of telepresence and virtual reality shows that this kind of model is not completely wrong-headed; if we place digital transducers between a human and the world, they can still function well." @@@ PENDING2. Page 2: Can you use infants instead of humans here to be consistent with prior sentence?	"This network of opportunities and frustrations should place limits on information processing that apply both to humans and robots with human-like sensors."@@@ Done.3. Page 2: "The perceptual [judgments] infants make change over time, showing a changing sensitivity to various cues." 	Can you please replace one of the change/changing with another word?@@@ "a changing sensitivity" replaced with "an evolving sensitivity"4. Page 2: The following (last 2 lines) is awkward: 	"through correlations with observable properties,"@@@ Sentence simplified greatly.5. Page 3: Can you prepend something like-- "On the computational and robotics side" before "There has been algorithmic progress; for example, give..."?@@@ Done: Prepended "On the engineering side"6. Page 3: It seems odd to give an automatic speech recognition example in the present context.@@@ In engineering terms it make sense.  It is one of the few familiarexamples of real machine perception to a general audience, for whichmany will have some experience of what is possible and what is stilldifficult.7. Page 4-The following seems vague-	"There is a great deal of infrastructure wrapped around the learning system to break the problem down into tractable parts and apply the results of learning back to the original problem."@@@ Rewritten: "This transformation [preprocessing and featureselection], and a corresponding transformation that applies theresults of the learning system back to the original problem, togethermake up a very important part of the full system."8. Page 4-" fleshes out into a functional system." This seems odd.@@@ "fleshes out" replaced with "produces"9. Page 4: "What, then, is the right algorithmic skeleton for object segregation? What set of algorithms, coupled with what kind of training data, would lead to best performance? We review suggestive work in infant development research and robotics."	It seems odd to follow in the last sentence with infant and robot since algorithm in the prior sentence is robotic.@@@ But that is the key point, work in infant development research ishelpful for this problem.10. Page 4: "By 4 to 5 months of age, infants can [visually] parse simple displays like the one in Figure 2"@@@ Amended11. Page 4: "Compared to adult judgements, we would expect such strategies to lead to many incorrect parsings"	Why?@@@ PENDING12. Page 4: "Infants do not come prepared from birth to segregate objects into units that match adult judgement."	I think you mean generally. Isn't there reason to think that some specific kinds of objects (e.g., faces) are detected by very young infants?@@@ PENDING13. Page 5: "Subsequent experiments have revealed that soon after this point in development" 	it would be nice to have an age@@@ PENDING14. Page 5: "[Still later,] 8.5 month old infants have been shown to also use information about..."@@@ Amended.15. Page 5: "Prior experiences with either portion of the test display were effective in facilitating infants' parsing of the test display."	What does this suggest?	Does this help the infant with generalization?@@@ PENDING16. Page 5: I wanted some more examples of possible key events in infants prior to section 2.2. @@@ PENDING17: Page 6: "is understood and can be tracked," do you mean "is [controlled]..." ?@@@ Replaced "understood" with "modelled"18: Page 7: "This system has a broader agenda than just this specific outcome; if"	"if" should be deleted.	I'm not sure what you mean by broader agenda.@@@ Omitted "if"@@@ Omitted "broader agenda", rewrote as "This specific goal is chosenin order to enable a broader set of outcomes:"19: Page 7: 'The specificity could be varied algorithmically, by adding or removing parts of a feature's "identity".'	For example?@@@ PENDING20: Page 7: "However, infants did benefit from the prior exposure when it was not in the features of the object but rather in its orientation (Needham, 2001)."	Could you please be more specific with "it"?@@@ PENDING21: Page 8: "Infants were given prior experiences with collections of ob jects, no one of  which was an effective cue to the composition of the test display when seen prior to testing."	I'm not fully understanding yet. Can you please give an example?@@@ PENDING22: Page 8: Can the key event idea be used here with infants?@@@ PENDING23: Page 9: "There is currently no serious robotics work to point to in this area, despite its importance."	Serious?	In this area? 	Can you elaborate please.@@@ Paragraph didn't say much, so was removed.24. Page 10: "In primates, for example, the visual information that reaches the visual cortex has a non-uniform distribution,"	What do you mean by non-uniform distribution?@@@ PENDING25. Page 11: "Exploiting actions for learning and perception requires the ability to match actions with the agents that caused it."	I'm not understanding.@@@ PENDING26. Page 12: "was employed to distinguish object of different shape, a"	plural on objects?@@@ Fixed.27. Page 13: "We have at identified"-drop 'at'@@@ Fixed.
