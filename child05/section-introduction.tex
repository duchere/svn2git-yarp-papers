Infants and robots both face the challenge of perceiving and acting on
the world around them.

We expect
that there will be commonality between how infants and successful
robots operate at the information-processing level, because natural
environments are of mixed, inconstant observability -- there are
properties of the environment that can be perceived under some
circumstances and not under others.  This network of opportunities and
frustrations should place limits on information processing that apply
both to humans and robots with human-like sensors.

We identify opportunities that can be exploited by both robots and
infants to perceive properties of their environment that cannot be
directly perceived in other circumstances.  We review what is known of
how robots and infants can exploit such opportunities to learn to make
reasonable inferences

%%of hidden object properties

about object properties that are not directly given in the display
%
through correlations
with observable properties, grounding those inferences in prior
experience.

Humanoid robots are improving mechanically by leaps and bounds.
Stable bipedal walking (at least on flat surfaces) is now a
commonplace, with running and jumping on the way.  There are
many, many problems remaining, but it is accurate to say that
there has been real progress mechanically.

But there are some danger signs.  In robot demonstrations today,
you're much more likely to see synchronized dancing, gesturing, and
talking than any physical interaction with objects.  Robot hands and
arms are currently rather limited mechanically, but more importantly
the {\em perceptual} component of manipulation is very hard, unless we
constrain the environment greatly.  And while in locomotion
constraining the floor to be flat is not so limiting, in manipulation
the corresponding constraint is for the object to be of a particular
shape, orientation, location, etc., which is much more limiting.

In the field of humanoid robotics, researchers have a special respect
and admiration for the abilities of infants.  They watch their newborn
children with particular interest, and their spouses have to
constantly be alert for the tell-tale signs of them running an ad-hoc
experiment.  It can be depressing to compare the outcome of a 
five-year, multi-million-euro/dollar/yen project with what an
infant can do after four months.

What is so difficult?
