This is a paper with terrific potential: solid introduction, well articulated examples and excellent cases for interaction between robotics and developmental psychology.  It just needs a bit of tuning before it is ready for public consumption.

Suggestions for revision:

1) While the introduction and conclusions are well-written, with the notable exception of the object segregation section, the interior parts feel incomplete and very separate -- almost piecemeal. The introduction makes the reader expect that each section will receive equal weight, but with 6 pages devoted to segregation (and four internal sections) and only four pages devoted to the remaining two sections the coverage is highly uneven (especially with less than a page for intermodal integration).

Suggestion: Drop the section on intermodal integration or regulate it to a future directions portion of the discussion (as in "this should also be looked at" as well). Use the added space to fill out the section on the role of embodiment , and then use the discussion to draw clear parallels between the two domains, explicitly showing how developmental robotics can help infant science and vice versa. Alternatively, you might consider focusing the whole paper on the object segregation -- although I'm not sure how well that would sit with all the authors.

@@@ PENDING: consider what to do with intermodal integration section.  
Perhaps shift emphasis to active perception.


2) Love the idea of number lists, as on page 12. Really helps pulls out the important findings of this section. Suggestion: Consider adding such lists for the first section and possibly the conclusions: distilling the most important lessons or "key events."

@@@ PENDING: Think of more number lists

 3) The figures also are incredibly illuminating. Suggestion: Consider adding some to the other section(s).

@@@ PENDING: Think of more figures to add
