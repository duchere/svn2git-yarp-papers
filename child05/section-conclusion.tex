Humanoid robots are improving mechanically by leaps and bounds.
Stable bipedal walking (at least on flat surfaces) is now a
commonplace, with running and jumping on the way.  There are
many, many problems remaining, but it is accurate to say that
there has been real progress mechanically.

But there are some danger signs.  In robot demonstrations today,
you're much more likely to see synchronized dancing, gesturing, and
talking than any physical interaction with objects.  Robot hands and
arms are currently rather limited mechanically, but more importantly
the {\em perceptual} component of manipulation is very hard, unless we
constrain the environment greatly.  And while in locomotion
constraining the floor to be flat is not so limiting, in manipulation
the corresponding constraint is for the object to be of a particular
shape, orientation, location, etc., which is much more limiting.

In the field of humanoid robotics, researchers have a special respect
and admiration for the abilities of infants.  They watch their newborn
children with particular interest, and their spouses have to
constantly be alert for the tell-tale signs of them running an ad-hoc
experiment.  It can be depressing to compare the outcome of a 
five-year, multi-million-euro/dollar/yen project with what an
infant can do after four months.


Is there a way to create a model of development which applies both to infants
and robots.  
%
For infants, this would be a theory of development, another way to
express current theories.
%
For robots, this would be an engineering tool, a guide to
construction.
%
On the infant side, empirical results would change, correct, and expand
the model.  On the robot side, construction effort would do the same.
%
%Of course, the results could diverge, but at least they are 
%comparable, and those interested in truly humanoid robots would
%work to stay synchronized.
%
Of course, there is a lot that would not fit in the model, and this is
as it should be.  It would be solely concerned with the class of 
functional, information-driven constraints.
