We are oriented towards a development environment, rather than
  a user environment.  This means we wish to support parts of the
  control system being manipulated while the rest runs.

We assume that restarting a process is expensive.  In a system
  of many processes, some of which may talk to custom hardware,
  some of which may maintain a history, this is true.
