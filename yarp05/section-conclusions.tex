To operate in natural, unengineered environments, we need perceptive
robots.  We hope that humanoid robots will ultimately be able to
operate productively in such environments.  That means that between
now and when that happens, we can only expect the sensor density and
computational burden on our robots to grow.  Real-time operation under
this burden is challenging enough, but we must also expect the
hardware we work with to change continually also.  The YARP library
has grown organically to face this challenge.

Somewhat similar projects have evolved from other domains in robotics
such as mobile navigation (Carmen/IPC~\cite{roy03IROS}) and
commercial/industrial robotics (Orocos~\cite{soetens05orocos}),
and we expect that there will be further development as the
{\em perceptual} component of robotics grows in importance.
