\subsection*{Zone of proximal development}

(this section is very vague)

For infants, the zone of proximal development is the
difference between what they can accomplish on their
own compared to what they can accompish with an
adult's support [CITE].

By loose analogy, we label a robot control system's ``zone of proximal
development'' to be the set of modules being actively added or worked
on by the programmer, against a background of pre-existing, operating
modules.  

YARP helps insulate existing modules from changes in this zone,
and leaves them in a good form for when the zone moves on.
