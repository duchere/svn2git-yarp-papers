\section{Communication}
\label{sec:communication}

%As stated in the introduction communication is an important topic in YARP, since
%we assume the robot is controlled by a pool of networked PCs.%  This is currently
%necessary for any robot doing signicant perceptual processing; for
%example object recognition {\em and} face detection {\em and}
%responsive motor control.  
%We do not assume those machines run the
%same operating system, since the availability of device drivers and
%can force such choices.
%
Communication in YARP follows the {\em Observer} pattern~\cite{gamma95design}.  The state
of special {\it Port} objects can be delivered to any number of
observers, in any number of processes distributed across any number of
machines.  YARP manages these connections in a way that insulates
the observed from the observer and, just as importantly, insulates
observers from each other.  For example,
if one observer reads a data source slowly and infrequently, this
does not force other observers to slow down.

%The communication abstraction is called a {\em Port}. 
%
In YARP,
a port is an active object 
managing multiple connections for a given unit of data either as input or output
(see Figure~\ref{fig:port}). Each connection has a state that can be manipulated
by external commands, which manage the connection or obtain state information from it. 
Ports can behave either as input or output.
%Although a single port can behave both as input and output, the 
%user interface, for ease of comprehension, enforces only one direction. 
An input port can receive from multiple connections at different data rates 
``speaking'' different protocols (e.g. TCP, UDP, multicast). An output port can 
send data to many destinations reading at different rates on different protocols.
Service channels are also temporarily created to perform the handshaking 
between ports; in this case the protocol of choice is TCP for reliability. 
The use of several different protocol allows us to exploit their best
characteristics:
%
\begin{itemize} \pflist
	\item TCP: reliable, it can be used to guarantee the reception of a message;
	\item UDP: faster than TCP, used for point to point connections;
	\item multicast: used for creating one to many connections, efficient for distributing
	the same information to many targets;
	\item shared memory: employed for local connections (selected automatically whenever possible, without the need for programmer intervention);
	\item QNet: a fast and synchronous protocol used under the QNX real-time OS.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
%
Ports can be connected either programmatically or at run-time.
%
%Each communication object, described next, can receive commands from other processes and 
%react consequently by activating or removing a specific connection.
%
%
Communication is fully asynchronous and as such messages are not guaranteed to be 
delivered unless special provisions are made. The default behavior of YARP ports 
is targetted at dealing with recurrent messages, updated and sent often, where losing 
one message does not compromise the integrity of the system. This is a characteristic
of sensor data such as images and sound, where it is far more important to keep
up with the present than to process every bit received.  
%
%YARP is definitely
%not an event based system since a single message is not guaranteed to get through. 
%
A typical application is, for example, the acquisition of images, and delivery to many 
machines performing the processing in parallel. Slower processes might simply not
use all the available frames in the stream of data and rather skip some of them.
%
Details of the port API are reported in the next section (Section~\ref{sect:code}).
Message delivery can be guaranteed, but at a cost or introducing a subtle coupling
between processes, as discussed later in this paper (see Section~\ref{sect:timing}).

	\caption{The port internal structure: in practice either input or output connections
	are used for a given instance of a port object.}
	\label{fig:port}
\end{figure}

%More recently, at the cost of bidirectional synchronization, a method for guaranteeing
%the delivery of messages has been added but this is not the most straightforward and
%natural use of ports.

%Reading from ports can be blocking, non-blocking (polling), or can happen on a callback.
%Writing is normally non-blocking, although it can be made to block depending on the requirements of the channel. In short, once data is available, a reference to a data
%buffer (of the same type of the data being received) is returned to the user code. This
%remains valid for the user to manipulate it as long as no other calls to the read function
%are made. 
%On a write, on the other hand, the buffer is passed to the trasmission code which deals
%with the details of the communication, while user code can continue execution.

Ports are located on the network by symbolic names which are managed by a name server.
%
%(the YARP name server). 
%
The name server maps symbolic names (strings) into the triplet 
composed of the IP address, port number, and interface name. This information is all 
that is required to establish socket communication between two endpoints. 
A description of the network topology is stored statically in the name server tables (a
cluster might have multiple separate networks) and used to reply to
registration or connection requests by the clients. The first operation each port must
perform is the registration of its name with the name server. 
%
%This allows then
%communicating to the port. 
%
Registration is typically followed by connection to a peer
of the same data type. When the user is done with the port, it can be stopped,
unregistered, and eventually destroyed.

Ports can deal with any data type. For simple data types (i.e. not containing pointers) 
the port class is already equipped with the appropriate communication code. Complex data
types are dealt by specializing the port C++ template for the 
new complex data type and providing the serialization and deserialization functions. 
Serialization is done by providing lists of memory blocks, to minimize copies (crucial
for bulky types such as images).
%
%This extension is relatively stereotyped and easily realized from client code: that is, 
%the library as such does not need to be rebuilt.
%
Support for marshalling is not built into the library.
%
%Finally, it is important to note that
%
Ports are implemented as C++ templates and 
specialized to the type of the data to be transmitted or received. This creates a very 
clean and consistent client interface.

\section{Port API}

\label{sect:code}

For concreteness, we will show an example of the idiom used in YARP
for communication.  As mentioned in the previous section, the Port class is the
key abstraction used. 
Ports are typically instantiated with a specific type.  For example, if we
wish to receive integers, we can create an input port at any point
in the program and in any thread, as follows:
%
\begin{verbatim}
    YARPInputPortOf<int> in_port;
    in_port.Register ("/my_in_port");
\end{verbatim}
%
\noindent This creates a port for receiving integers with the default
buffering provided by the communication layer (see
Section~\ref{sect:timing} for a discussion of alternatives).  If we
are in a heterogeneous network, it would be wiser to use {\tt
YARPInputPortOf<NetInt32>}, where {\tt NetInt32} is a standard integer
type that is the same size and byte order on all platforms.  The next
statement instructs the port to register with the name server with the
arbitrary name ``/my\_in\_port''. A hypothetical sender should conversely
create a port as in the following example:
%
\begin{verbatim}
    YARPOutputPortOf<int> out_port;
    out_port.Register ("/my_out_port");
\end{verbatim}
%
\noindent This is an output port employing the default protocol (TCP, or shared memory whenever
possible); alternatives can be easily requested.  The protocol type
is determined by the output port since the input port can receive any of the available
protocols. Again, the port has to register with the name server by calling 
{\em Register}. As described earlier, the port is a template with the argument of the
template being the type of the data being sent.

The next step is to wait for data from the input port and send data through the output port
Waiting or polling for data can be done in several ways; here's one way:
%
\begin{verbatim}
    if (in_port.Read()) {
        int datum = in_port.Content();
        cout << datum << endl;
    }
\end{verbatim}
%
\noindent 
This shows how to read from the port with a blocking {\em Read} and
acquire the received data through {\em Content}. If the call to {\em
Read} succeeds, then the object returned by any subsequent call to
{\em Content} will be the received data, and is guaranteed not to
change or be overwritten until the next call to {\em Read}.
If new data is sent to the port in the meantime, the appropriate
action will be taken based on the port buffering policy (see Section~\ref{sect:timing}).  For example,
the data may be stored in an alternate buffer and then queued up to 
become the {\em Content} after the next call to {\em Read}.
%
On the sending side we will have something 
like:
%
\begin{verbatim}
    out_port.Content() = 42;
    out_port.Write ();
\end{verbatim}
%
\noindent This fills the content (a simple integer in this case) by
accessing the buffer through {\em Content} and sends it by calling
{\em Write}.  The use of {\em Content} is important to avoid unnecessary copies
while still maintaining an abstraction barrier between the port and the user.
%
%
We can now connect the two processes (one receiving,
one sending) by, for example, using the YARP command-line utility {\em yarp-connect}:

\begin{verbatim}
yarp-connect /my_out_port /my_in_port    
\end{verbatim}

\noindent 
%As explained,
%the communication code is fairly independent from the remaining code and easily separated
%by any other code the user might have developed already, even other communications 
%mechanisms. 
%
When done with the communication the user can detach the ports in a similar way.
% using the same
%utility (note the exclamation mark before the receiver name):
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%yarp-connect /my_out_port !/my_in_port 
%\end{verbatim}
%
The ports are not destroyed by detaching them and in fact can be connected and disconnected
freely. When done with the ports the user code can call {\em Unregister} to 
remove the ports from the name server, and finally destroy them by invocation of the C++
destructor (perhaps implicitly when exiting the port scope).

The {\em Write} method abstracts over a great deal of complexity.
An output port may be connected to many input ports, all of which
may read data at different rates.  By default, when {\em Write}
is called, a reference to the buffer is passed to
every free output connection (to block and wait for all sends to finish before trying the next one, {\em FinishSend} can be called).  The buffer will be retained
until it is no longer needed by any output connection, and then
given back to the port to be recycled.  
%After each call to
%{\em Write} the output of {\em Content} may change, with
%a pool of buffers growing to a worst case of one for each
%output connection, plus one extra for the client.

This short example shows all the main features of the port classes including the strong
typing of the communication channels, the independence of the connected processes, and
the use of an external utility to command ports.
%
Port creation, connection, and communication can occur in one part of a much larger
program without, for example, having to place special initialization steps in some
particular phase of start-up.  This makes it very easy to add YARP-style communication
incrementally to existing code.

\section{Decoupling timing}

\label{sect:timing}

A very useful feature of YARP is that ``observers'' (input ports) can be connected to an
``observable'' (output port) with minimal impact on existing
observers.
%
A ``slow'' observer, which takes time to process each update it
received from the observable, does not force a ``fast'' observer of
the same observable to slow down.  To achieve this requires either buffering
of messages for bursty sources, or simply dropping messages for
observers that can't keep up.  The second approach is the default
behavior in YARP, since it is important to minimize latency.

Let us assume we have a ``server'' process which contains an
observable (an output port), and a ``client'' process
which contains a corresponding observer (an input port).
The server process can update the observable in one of three ways:

\begin{itemize} \pflist

\item The default mechanism is \textbf{\textit{no-wait}}.  When the
server process calls the observable's update method ({\it Write}),
then the current state of the observable is made available to be sent
to every free observer, and the server can continue without delay.
Free observers are ones not currently in the process of reading a
previous state of the observable.

\item An alternate mechanism is \textbf{\textit{wait-after}}.  After the same 
steps as {\it no-wait} are taken, the server can choose
to wait for all communication to cease before continuing (by 
calling {\it FinishSend}).  This guarantees that all observers will
be notified and free to receive the next update.

\item The final mechanism is \textbf{\textit{wait-before}}.  The server can choose
to wait for all communication to cease before updating (by calling a
blocking version of {\it Write}).  This guarantees that all observers
will be free, and the update will be sent to all of them.  The
difference between this and {\it wait-after} is that, if the processing
time of the server (the time between updates) is greater than the time 
taken to send the update to all observers, then the server will never
actually need to wait.

\end{itemize}

\noindent
%
To insulate the server from the details of implementing all this, the
state associated with an observable is made logically distinct from
the observable itself, and once an update is requested (by a call to
{\em Write}) the state becomes the property of the communication
system, while the server is given a replacement object to prepare for
the next update.
%
The communication system manages a pool of such state objects which
grows to whatever size is necessary based on the speed of the various
observers.
%
%
On the client side, there are some choices in how the
observer behaves:

\begin{itemize} \pflist

\item \textbf{\textit{triple-buffer}} behavior: an observer becomes free for
another update immediately after having received one, before any
processing is done by the client.  If updates arrive faster than
processing occurs, then updates will be lost from time to time (where
``lost'' means ``never processed''), but the most recent update
received will always be available to the client immediately when processing
is completed.

\item \textbf{\textit{double-buffer}} behavior: same as above, but if
an update is currently arriving, then no new content will be available
to the client until the update arrives.  This is good if it is better
to minimize latency of non-dropped updates than to maximize
throughput.

\item \textbf{\textit{single-buffer}} behavior: the arrival of updates
is delayed until the client completes processing.  No updates will ever be 
lost on the client side.


\end{itemize}

\noindent The default behavior for YARP is \textit{no-wait} for
the observable (server side) and \textit{triple-buffer} for 
the observer (client side).  This
choice minimizes the time spent waiting for communication to occur by
the server and the client, and permits updates to be lost (either by
never sending them, or discarding them on the client side) if the
client is not keeping up.  This is generally a good choice for
real-time performance  (See Figure~\ref{fig:throughput-nowait}).

The default of \textit{no-wait} on the server side is particularly
important, since it minimizes coupling between observers of the same
observable.  If it is important that updates are never lost, then
inevitably there will be coupling, since a slow client can then force
the server to slow down the rate at which it serves all clients.

The default of \textit{triple-buffer} on the client side insulates the
server from the client's behavior by default.  Even if the server is
configured to wait, default clients will only delay the server
with the time taken to communicate with them, and not the time
they take to process the update.  Clients which absolutely
need a guarantee of zero update loss can choose \textit{single-buffer}
behavior.
