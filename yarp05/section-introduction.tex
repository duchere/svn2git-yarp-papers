\section{Introduction}

YARP is written by and for researchers in robotics, particularly
humanoid robotics, who find themselves with a complicated pile of
hardware to control with an equally complicated pile of software.

At the time of writing, running decent visual, auditory, and tactile
perception while performing elaborate motor control in real-time
requires a lot of computation. The easiest and most scalable way to do
this at the moment is to have a cluster of computers. Every year what
one machine can do grows, but so do our demands~-- especially for
research groups which by definition operate at the limits of current
technology. YARP is a set of tools we have found useful for meeting
our computational needs for controlling various humanoid robots.

Although YARP offers support for communication, image processing,
interfacing to hardware etc., it is written with an {\em open world}
mindset.  We do not assume it will be the only library used, and
endeavor to be as friendly to other libraries as possible.
