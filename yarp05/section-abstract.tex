We describe YARP, Yet Another Robot Platform, an open-source project
that encapsulates lessons from our experience in building humanoid
robots.  Humanoid robotics is a ``bleeding edge'' field of 
research, with constant flux in sensors, actuators, and 
processors.  Code reuse and maintainance is therefore a significant 
challenge. We describe the main problems we had to face and the 
solutions we adopted. The main features of YARP include support for inter-process
communication, image processing as well as a class hierarchy
to maximize code reuse across different hardware platforms. YARP
is currently used and tested on Windows, Linux and QNX6 which are common 
operating systems used in robotics. With YARP, we lay the ground-work for long-term
software development. [need to review this]
