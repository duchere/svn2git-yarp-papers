We describe YARP, Yet Another Robot Platform, an open-source project
that encapsulates lessons from our experience in building humanoid
robots.  Humanoid robotics is a ``bleeding edge'' field of 
research, with constant flux in sensors, actuators, and 
processors.  Code reuse is therefore a significant 
challenge.  With YARP, we placed some constraints on the 
processors used, and laid the ground-work for reuse...

YARP greatly improved our ability to 
reuse code.
