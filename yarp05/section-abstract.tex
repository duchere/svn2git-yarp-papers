We describe YARP, Yet Another Robot Platform, an open-source project
that encapsulates lessons from our experience in building humanoid
robots.  Humanoid robotics is a ``bleeding edge'' field of 
research, with constant flux in sensors, actuators, and 
processors.  Code reuse is therefore a significant 
challenge.  With YARP, we lay the ground-work for long-term
software development.
