http://www.ars-journal.com/ars/Special_Issue.htm

They want a PDF and DOC.

Can make a rough HTML version with:
  latex2html -split 0
Can then make a rough DOC by opening result with open office, then exporting
to DOC format.

International Journal on Advanced Robotics Systems Special Issue on
"Software Development and Integration in Robotics"


The development of autonomous robotic systems face severe challenges due to
the heterogeneous nature of the technological issues involved. The process
of bringing intelligence to a robot requires the tight integration of
sensing, processing, and acting capabilities. Software plays a key role as
it is the medium to embody intelligence in the machine.
As robotics systems are becoming more  complex, distributed, and integrated,
there is the need to promote the construction of new systems as composition
of reusable building blocks.  System modularity and interoperability are key
factors that enable the development of reusable software. If a system is
modular, its functionality can be customized by replacing individual
components. When two or more systems are interoperable, they can be (re)used
as components of more complex systems.

This special issue seeks papers that present the challenges and demonstrate
the effectiveness of software development and integration techniques in
building robotic systems, such as software architectures, application
frameworks, design patterns, middleware, and software processes.

Authors are invited to submit papers that describe their experience with the
development and integration of robotic software systems and capture the
lessons learned in moving toward modular and reusable software developments
in robotics. The editors are particularly interested in papers that identify
recurring themes and challenges in the development and integration of
software components and systems from various robotic domains


Topics of interest

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Crafting modular software control systems for robotic applications
* Integration of robotic software systems
* Reuse of robotic software systems and applications
* Description of work in progress, innovative ideas, field-based studies,
related to the adoption of software development techniques in building
robotic systems
* Scalability of various approaches to software modularity and reuse
* Challenges and research directions


Important dates

* Deadline for submissions: July 15, 2005
* Author's notification: October 15, 2005
* Final paper submission: December 1, 2005
* Special issue's publication: March 2006


Submissions

Authors are encouraged to  clearly present the novelty of their work, its
impact on the development of software systems in the robotics domain, to
place their work appropriately in the intellectual context of the
development of the field, and to ensure that their presentation is clear and
concise. Submissions will be peer reviewed. The papers should not be
published or submitted somewhere else.

Papers should not exceed 6 pages. Instructions to prepare the manuscripts
can be found at the journal web site http://www.ars-journal.com/ following
the link to "Publishing of Manuscripts". .Submissions should be sent both in
doc and pdf format via email to brugali@unibg.it  with the subject "ARS
special issue".
Authors wishing to discuss potential submissions are encouraged to contact
the editor Davide Brugali. Information about the International Journal of
Advanced Robotics Systems can be found on the journal's web site at
