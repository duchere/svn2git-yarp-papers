In this Section we detail the process of gathering data from human
subjects and processing them in order to make them suitable for
analysis by a machine learning system.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

\subsubsection*{Devices}

We collected data using a $22$-sensors Immersion CyberGlove for the
hand posture \cite{cyberglove}, an Ascension Flock-Of-Birds (FoB) for
the hand position \cite{fob} and a Force Resistor Sensor (FSR) to
detect the contact moment with the object. Figure \ref{fig:devices}
shows the devices, as worn by a subject.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \caption{The devices used for the experiment, as worn by a
    subject: $(a)$ the CyberGlove, with the Flock-of-Birds just above
    the subject's wrist; $(b)$ the Force Resistor Sensor attached to
    the subject's thumb.}
    \label{fig:devices}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The CyberGlove was worn by the subject on the right hand. The device
returns $22$ $8$-bit numbers linearly related to the angles between
the ends of the sensors and roughly indicating the angles between the
subject's hand joints; the sensors are embedded in the glove in order
for them to be adherent to the subject's skin. The resolution of the
sensors is on average about $0.5$ degree \cite{cyberglove}, but the
noise associated with the sensors has been experimentally determined
to be $1.1$ on average and $3$ at the maximum \cite{212431}. The
sensors describe the position of the three phalanxes of each finger
(for the thumb, rotation and two phalanxes), the four finger-to-finger
abductions, the palm arch, the wrist pitch and the wrist yaw.

The FoB was firmly mounted on the CyberGlove, just above the subject's
wrist, with the $X/Y$ plane being parallel to the palm plane in the
resting position. The device returns $6$ double-precision numbers
describing the position ($x$, $y$ and $z$ in inches) and rotation
(azimuth, elevation and roll in angles) of the sensor with respect to
a magnetic basis mounted about one meter away from the subject. The
FoB's resolution is $0.1$ inches and $0.5$ degrees \cite{fob}.

Lastly, the FSR was mounted on the subject's thumb. It returns a
$32$-bit number approximately inversely proportional to the pressure
applied to the surface of the sensor. We only used the FSR as an
on-off indicator of when the sunbject made contact with the object.

All data were collected, synchronised, and saved in real time at a
frequency of $50$Hz.

\subsubsection*{Subjects}

Eleven subjects, four females and seven males aged $24$ to $34$ of
different nationalities, joined the experiment. They were all
right-handed and fully able-bodied, and were given initially some
knowledge of the aim of the experiment.

\subsubsection*{Method}

The subjects were asked to sit confortably in front of a clean
workspace of about one squared meter, at the center of which an object
was placed, in a predefined position. The subjects were then asked to
wear the devices and choose a resting position for their right hand
and arm. They were then instructed to grasp the object with their
right hand any way they wanted, not necessarily the same way each
time, keeping a ``natural'' attitude. After grasping the object, they
had to drop it somewhere else in the workspace, and then return their
right hand and arm in the initial resting position. Subsequently, they
had to use their left hand to reposition the object roughly in the
same place it was before.

We first had the subjects do a trial run of the experiment, in order
for them to gain confidence in the setup. A beeping sound was heard
each time the subject made contact with the object (that is, each time
the FSR signalled a significant change), and they were asked to try
and hear the beep each time they grasped the object. Although this
ruled out grasps which made no use of the thumb, it enabled us to
better gather the contact points.

After the trial run, subjects were asked to repeat the
grasp/drop/reposition procedure $120$ times per each object. We will
call both this procedure and the data time sequence gathered during
the procedure, a \emph{session}. We employed, in turn, three objects:
a beer can, a scotch tape roll and a mug (Figure \ref{fig:objects}
shows the objects). The object were chosen so that each one could be
grasped in several different ways, but with a certain degree of
overlapping, e.g., both the beer can and the mug could be grasped
cylindrically, but only the mug could be grasped using the handle.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ccc}
      \includegraphics[height=0.2\textheight]{beer.eps} &

      $(a)$ & $(b)$ & $(c)$
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{The objects used in the experiment: a beer can $(a)$, a
    scotch tape roll $(b)$ and a mug $(c)$.}
    \label{fig:objects}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Each experiment employed one subject and consisted of six sessions:
first the can, then the roll and then the mug, all of this two times,
for an approximate total of $720$ grasps per subject, $240$ per
object. The numbers are not precise since now and then the subjects
would grasp without properly activating the FSR. This problem has been
corrected in the batch analysis of data. Moreover, in two cases the
FSR broke down toward the end of the experiment, resulting in a
slightly smaller number of grasps.

Each experiment lasted $35$ to $56$ minutes depending on the subject's
confidence and speed; although almost no subjects reported tiredness,
we allowed for rest between each session. It was reported by almost
every subject that the experiment became rapidly boring, which lets us
claim that almost all grasps were done in a natural, almost
unconscious way. Figure \ref{fig:setup} shows the main phases of the
experiment.

    a clean workspace, at the center of which an object is placed
    $(a)$, with his right hand in a resting position. He then grasps
    the object and drops it somewhere else in the workspace $(b)$,
    bringing then his arm and hand in the resting position. Lastly, he
    repositions the object in the initial position using his left arm
    and hand $(c)$.}

\subsection{Building the training set}

\subsubsection*{Detecting grasps}

In order to figure out when each single grasp starts and ends in a
session, we first observed the values of the FSR mounted on the
subject's thumb. We manually verified that the FSR correctly reacted
in almost all cases with a spike, signalling, whenever the subject
made contact with the object, a significantly different value from
that recorded elsewhere shortly before the contact. The spike instants
were taken as the \emph{ending} points of each grasp, and were
gathered by checking when the first derivative of the FSR value
dropped by more than $10\%$ of its overall minimum value. Moreover,
after each spike, we ignored one second of the session, in order not
to detect possible spurious spikes which happened immediately after
the grasp, due to object slippage and/or blurred values coming from
the FSR.

Subsequently, in order to detect the \emph{starting} point of each
grasp, for each ending point we observed the hand speed and
acceleration, averaged over $0.2$ seconds, from the ending point
backwards. Since we had instructed the subjects to always return to
the resting position before initiating a new grasp, when the grasp
starts, the speed must be close to zero and the acceleration must be
negative (the subject's arm is moving \emph{toward} the FoB's
reference point). Therefore, we set the grasp starting point at the
nearest moment in time before the ending point in which the hand speed
was close to zero and the hand acceleration was negative. In order to
avoid detecting spurious speed/acceleration glitches when the hand
made contact with the object, we ignored $0.1$ seconds just before the
ending point; moreover, we ignored grasps which resulted shorter than
$280$ milliseconds. All these values were determined experimentally to
be near optimal in order to catch as many grasps as possible while
avoiding spurious ones.

Figure \ref{fig:grasp_sequence} $(a)$ shows an example set of detected
grasps. As one can see, the hand speed (green curve) shows the well
known bell-shaped curve during a grasp \cite{...} {\bf GIORGIO metti
una citazione qui}: the hand speed diminishes, reaches a minimum and
then gets back to zero till the ending point of the grasp.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ccc}
      \includegraphics[width=0.48\linewidth]{grasp_seq_scotch.eps} &
      \includegraphics[width=0.48\linewidth]{grasp_trend.eps} \\
      $(a)$ & $(b)$
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{$(a)$ Detecting the grasps. The Figure shows $10$ seconds
    of a subject grasping an object. The red bands indicate the
    start and end of a grasp; the black line is the FSR response; and
    the green line is the hand speed. As one can see, the ending
    points are found near the FSR spike, indicating contact; moreover,
    the hand speed shows the well known bell-shaped curve during a
    grasp. $(b)$ Grasps duration. The Figure shows the speed of the grasps
    (moving average over 50 grasps) averaged for all subjects. As the
    experiments advance, the grasping durations become shorter and
    shorter.}
    \label{fig:grasp_sequence}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Overall, the procedure could recognise $716 \pm 12$ grasps for each
subject, which matches the desired result of $720$ ($120$ per session,
each user running six sessions). As far as the two subjects who broke
down the FSR, the procedure recognised $550$ and $649$ grasps. The
data were also manually observed in order to verify that spurious
detected grasps would be an insignificant fraction of the total
grasps.

\subsubsection*{Grasping speed}

In general, in order to make time sequences suitable for a machine
learning system, they must be all the same length\footnote{an
interesting possbility is that of employing a kernel which can
consider time sequences of different lenghts, see
e.g. \cite{shimodaira02dynamic}. This issue is the subject of future
research.}; in order to do this, since in general not all grasps have
the same length, it is crucial to have an idea of how fast each grasp
is. Figure \ref{fig:grasp_sequence} $(b)$ shows the average grasp
durations for all subjects over each experiment (moving average over
$50$ grasps); as one would expect, in general the subjects get rapidly
used to the grasp/drop/reposition task and the grasps become faster
and faster. It must be remarked, though, that this is not the case for
all subjects considered one by one.

On average, the grasp duration is $0.62 \pm 0.20$ seconds. We decided
then to stretch every grasp to $1$ second by linear interpolation,
obtaining fixed-length time sequences of $50$ samples for each sensor
and grasp.
