 Real-time, online place recognition must be performed in most
  complex robot navigation tasks. In this paper we analyse the
  benefits of a novel online reduced-rank Support Vector
  Classification method in such a framework.

  In particular, we show that this method is able to retain the
  accuracy of the non-reduced method, while allowing for a reduction
  in the space requirement of up to XXXX%.
