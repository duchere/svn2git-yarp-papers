Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the most successful algorithms
for classification. Due to the space and time requirements of the SVM
they are not suitable for online learning with endless stream of  
training
observations. In this paper we present a new online algorithm  that we  
call
On-line Independent Support Vector Machine (OISVM), which approximately
converges to the SVM solution at each round. The approximation can be
controlled by a user-defined parameter and by the type of the kernel  
used.
As opposed to similar algorithms, the resulting time and space  
requirements
of the proposed algorithm are asymptotically bounded. The proposed  
algorithm
approximately project every new instance that is chosen to be added to  
the
support set onto the support set obtained so far, and by that reducing
dramatically the time and space requirements without reducing accuracy.
These statements are supported by extensive experiments on standard
benchmark databases as well as on two real-world applications, namely,
place recognition by a mobile robot in an indoor environment,
and human grasping posture classification.
