Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are one of the most successful
algorithms for classification. However, due to their space and time
requirements, they are not suitable for on-line learning, that is,
when presented with an endless stream of training observations.

In this paper we propose a new on-line algorithm, called On-line
Independent Support Vector Machines (OISVMs), which approximately
converges to the standard SVM solution each time new observations
are added; the approximation is controlled via a user-defined parameter.
The method employs a set of linearly independent observations
and tries to project every new observation onto the set
obtained so far, dramatically reducing time and space requirements
at the price of a negligible loss in accuracy. As opposed to similar
algorithms, the size of the solution obtained by OISVMs is always
bounded, implying a bounded testing time. These statements are
supported by extensive experiments on standard
benchmark databases as well as on two real-world applications, namely
place recognition by a mobile robot in an indoor environment and
human grasping posture classification.
