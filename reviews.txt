The authors present a methodology for adapting EMG-based
hand prostheses.
The paper is well-written, contains thorough results. The
only review objecting to its objection has few real
argument, however, one argument of his holds by closer
inspection of the paper and that is the lack of a robot
application. Similarly, the machine learning side is build
on a relatively well-developed base. Thus, the main novelty
lies in the actual application. However, this would still
turn the paper into a fair publication.

The authors present a methodology to adapt EMG-based hand
prostheses using previously trained models from different
subjects. The approach is based on previous work by Yang,
Yan and Hauptmann on SVM-regression/classification, which
is generalized to multiple models and applied to EMG-based
prostheses.

The paper addresses an interesting and relevant problem,
the proposed methodology appears sound, and convincing
empirical evidence for its usefulness is presented. Also,
most of the paper is well written and thus easy to follow.
My main (and really only major) criticism concerns the
description of the automatic determination of beta, the
weights assigned to previously learned models (Section
II.B). While this appears central to the proposed
methodology, the authors do not explain in detail how beta
is determined. Also, in the section describing the
experimental results no empirical data regarding beta is
presented. For example, it would be interesting to see by
how much beta differs between previously trained models.
Further, I wonder why the authors only use the best of all
previously trained models rather than a weighted average?

Minor issues:
- In equation (4) it might be useful to point out that
alpha refers to the Lagrange multipliers.
- I assume 100'' and 30'' refers to 100s and 30s,
respectively?
- Section V: "asymptotic" instead of "asyntotic".
- The observation that even for large training sets the
adapted models perform better than those trained from
scratch is indeed very surprising and could/should be
investigated in some more detail.
- Full stop missing before last sentence of Section I.

This paper presents an algorithm for EMG classification and
regression based on Least-Squares SVM with model
adaptation.  Experimental results are also shown.

This paper is well written with nice introduction and
motivation.  Results do appear to be promising, but are not
necessarily conclusive.  Additionally, I wish more details
were given on the algorithmic implementation.  

The main goal of this model adaptation approach is to
reduce the training time.  As expected, no significant
improvement is obtained with large training sets.  However,
a reported average of 5% classification improvement using
only 30 samples (about 1 second of data at 25Hz) is
promising, but the high variance is discouraging.  One
subject is reported to have a 15% increase, why is this not
shown as your best-case subject?  Additionally, some
subjects had decreased performance, exactly how many?  In
addition to reporting averages, it would be helpful to the
reviewers to show individual statics (at least for small
training sets) for each subject (since you only have 10).  
  

It is not completely clear how the beta or the w' in
equation 3 are selected.  It is claimed that these are
selected "optimally", but since this is the main
theoretical contribution of this paper, you should give
much more detail on how these are determined.  

It would be very interesting to see how performance varies
with the number of models used (i.e N=5,10,15,20, etc).  In
particular, will the high variance seen in fig. 4 be
reduced with more models?  I encourage you to collect data
form more subjects.  Additionally how will the computation
time scale with higher N?  

Also, figures 4-6 need to have thicker lines that are
easier to read.

This manuscripts presents some preliminary results on
detecting grasping postures from EMG recordings. The
movitation is prosthetic hand control.
Prosthetic hand control is an interesting and signitificant
topic. However, I cannot find a significant contribution in
this article:
- No application to robotic hand is shown
- The better performance of "adapt" vs "no adapt" is close
to 
  obvious
- No convincing improvement over the Bitzer and v.d. Smagt 
     
  ICRA paper; these authors already controlled a real robot
   
  hand with EMG

I suggest comparison with the controller of the Touch
Bionic hand on the real system.

In general, this is a good paper in the right direction, I
have only a few comments:

Isn't the use of LS-SVM is a bit problematic for EMG data
as it is noisy. The outliers have higher impact in LS-SVM
than regular SVM, right?

The plots given in the figures are hard to read. It will be
better if thicker lines are used.

I have a feeling that the improvement (even in the best
case) is not as high as one would expect. Could it be due
to the noise amplification of the least squares ?

Although the authors state a reason for using correlation
coefficient for presenting the regression performances, I
am not totally convinced. I think it would be better to see
the actual prediction errors as well.
