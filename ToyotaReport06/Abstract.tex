In this report we discuss the implementation of a precise reaching controller on a humanoid upper torso. The proposed solution is based on a learning strategy which does not rely on any \emph{a priori} known model of the arm and head kinematics. The only major simplification is represented by the assumption that the hand model is already available. In fact, from a practical point of view, the problem of creating a realistic model of the hand is a stand alone problem which falls outside the scope of this project. Future experiments will be based on a self-constructed model of the hand.
