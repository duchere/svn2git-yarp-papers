In this report we discuss the implementation of a precise reaching controller 
on a humanoid upper torso. The proposed solution is based on a learning 
strategy which does not rely on any \emph{a priori} known model of the arm 
and head kinematics. The only major simplification is represented by the 
assumption that a visual model of the hand is available (i.e. the robot 
can visually localize the hand). In fact, from a practical point of view, 
the problem of creating a visual model of the hand is a stand alone problem 
which falls outside the scope of this project. Future experiments will be 
based on a self-acquired model of the hand.
